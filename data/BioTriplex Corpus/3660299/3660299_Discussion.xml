RPL is found in 1–5% of couples desiring pregnancy. Despite various efforts to find an etiologic factor for RPL, ∼50% of these cases remain unexplained. A plethora of factors have been addressed that are associated with the pathophysiology of RPL in PCOS. The common metabolic derailments of the syndrome like obesity and IR have been implicated as individual risk factors for RPL  [26] . Recent evidences suggest another metabolic component, HHcy, to be a frequent associate in subjects with PCOS. Moreover, mild-to-moderate HHcy has been suggested as a possible threat to women with habitual abortions or placental abruption  [27] . Hence, the heterogeneous syndrome comprises different metabolic factors (IR, obesity, HHcy) which can cause hindrance in isolation or combination for the maintenance of pregnancy. Here we report, HHcy  per se  has got a higher probable association (43.32%) with miscarriage in a small cohort of women diagnosed with RPL.
Two separate populations suffering from RPL were addressed in this investigation: one diagnosed with PCOS, while other was the non-PCOS segment. Both populations were represented with occurrence of HHcy, obesity or IR, which were the phenotypes the further stratifications based upon.
There is no international consensus regarding the establishment of a cut-off point for HHcy and hence different epidemiological studies set up dissimilar cut-off values. However, Hcy values of between 10 and 12 µmol/L in pregnant individuals are considered borderline elevated  [28] . Fasting plasma total Hcy value of 12 µmol/L was therefore, set as the cut-off limit for the present investigation. Evaluation of the impact of different degrees of obesity on the risk of recurrent miscarriage demonstrated that not a mild increase in the BMI (25.0–29.9 kg/m 2 ), but obesity characterized by BMI>30 kg/m 2 , increases the risk of miscarriage  [24] . We therefore set BMI value of 30 kg/m 2  as the cut-off to differentiate obese from non-obese population.
Rate of miscarriage between the hyperhomocysteinemic populations of both groups were significantly higher than that of the corresponding normo-homocysteinemic segments (p value<0.0001; p value<0.008). Moreover, the subjects in our study showed a significant correlation (r = 0.343, p value<0.05) with the rate of miscarriage in the PCOS population diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria which achieved a greater correlation (r = 0.342, p value<0.02) after controlling for the HOMA2-IR values. This suggests that HHcy may set the ground behind the risk of RPL irrespective of IR/non-IR subjects. Alongside, it also raises the issue concerning earlier studies that whether HHcy was segregated from the insulin resistant population to envisage its individual role to RPL.
In the current investigation, a linear regression analysis described homocysteine as the independent variable affecting RPL. However, the connection between IR and HHcy stands tall as HOMA2-IR (r = 0.196, p value<0.029) and PP insulin (r = 0.421, p value<0.001) levels emerged as the most significant parameters after controlling for other variables, affecting homocysteine levels with no significant correlation with BMI. We however didn't take interest to evaluate miscarriage owing to obesity as a mild increase in the BMI (25.0–29.9 kg/m 2 ) found in our patient cohort do not really impact on the risk of recurrent miscarriage  [24] .
Bayesian networks have been around in biomedicine and health-care for more than a decade and have become increasingly popular for handling the uncertain knowledge involved in establishing diagnoses of disease. For controlling the diagnostic complexity in the field of RPL, a proper understanding of the processes is important as is the ability to reason about them. It is apparent that the numbers of variables are many and to come to a conclusion as to which variable(s) is/are playing leading part, network analysis definitely helps under such circumstances. From the learned model, a most likely diagnosis of 34.37% of unconditional probability has been observed in women experiencing miscarriage. While using a homocysteine threshold of 12 µmol/L, HOMA2-IR: 2.1, BMI: 30 kg/m 2  and on the presence or absence of PCOS, we found that HHcy has got the maximum probable associate ship with the rate of miscarriage in women in Kolkata, India. This was supported by the ROC-AUC predictive accuracy expressed, as it increased slightly to 0.778 while using a homocysteine threshold of 12 µmol/L.
A high proportion of PCOS patients have a greater risk for spontaneous abortion due to the individual anatomic defect or the confounding factors associated with it  [26] . The comparison among PCOS and non-PCOS patients in the current study gave us opportunity to cue at the anatomical problem alone. However, we did not find any significant associate-ship of PCO morphology in the designed probabilistic model.
The mechanism linking IR with RPL may be complicated. Hyperinsulinemia adversely affects the pre-implantation environment by decreasing the expression of glycodelin and IGF-binding protein-1  [29]  which may play a role in inhibiting the endometrial immune response of the embryo, and seems to facilitate adhesion processes at the feto-maternal interface. A positive relationship between HOMA2-IR and spontaneous abortion in quite a few numbers of studies suggest IR as a significant predictor of pregnancy wastage  [15] ,  [16] . Elevated PAI-I (an endogenous inhibitor of fibrinolysis) levels have an independent association-ship with recurrent miscarriages in women in this respect  [21] . A recent report documented in patients receiving metformin that PAI-1is positively correlated with the HOMA score  [30] . In the small patient cohort selected, HOMA2-IR stands as the second most important individual causal factor to be linked with the risk of RPL as analysed by the ROC curve and the networking model.
Increased thrombosis caused by HHcy resulting microthrombi formation in the vessel bed of the placenta can impair sustained placental function  [3] . These microthrombi may cause multiple placental infarctions and subsequently maternal complications of pregnancy. Apart from the thrombogenic effect of elevated Hcy on pregnancy in women with PCOS, few recent studies have also implicated the adverse effect of high serum or follicular fluid Hcy levels on defect in folliculogenesis  [31] , embryo quality  [32] , oocyte numbers and oocyte maturation  [33] , that may have future bearings on the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Thus, homocysteine may be responsible for more reasons than one for the increased miscarriage rates.
The current study has some limitations. The gold standard for establishing IR is euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp which has not been in routine clinical practice. Instead, we used HOMA2-IR calculation which is often used as a surrogate marker for IR  [34] . Along with this, the variables by which homocysteine levels are influenced like smoking, renal function, vitamin B status and enzyme dysfunction states were not examined in this study. However, all of the patients in our clinic are actively discouraged from smoking.
In conclusion, HHcy mediated RPL is one of the most significant contributor which plays a substantial role in spontaneous abortion of sub-continental women. Moreover, various studies report the role of folic acid  [35] ,  [36] , Vit B6 & B12 supplementation  [37]  and LMWH (unpublished observations) in improving pregnancy outcomes in women with HHcy. Thus, the role of identification and active treatment of Hcy in these women at high risk of subsequent miscarriage should be emphasised upon. Further studies are required to confirm our findings and to assess the efficacy of vitamin supplementation &/or anticoagulation in prevention of further miscarriage in women with HHcy.
