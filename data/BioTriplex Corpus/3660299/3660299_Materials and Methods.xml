Ethics statement
The investigation was performed with approval from the Research Ethics Board of the Institute (project no: IRM/IEC/BNC-IHP/37) and informed consent was obtained from all study participants.
Hormonal and biochemical measurements and calculations
Blood samples were collected between 2 nd  and 4 th  days of a menstrual cycle of healthy controls and of women with PCOS after a spontaneous bleeding episode after an overnight fast. TSH, PRL, FSH, LH, testosterone (total), insulin and homocysteine (Hcy) were assayed in serum with automated chemiluminescence assay system using an Immulite® platform (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <10% for all assays performed. Glucose levels were measured using VITROS dry chemistry system® (Ortho-clinical diagnostics, France). Definition of normal concentrations of plasma homocysteine differs substantially between different studies (5 to 16 µmol/L) although 12 µmol/L were set as the cut-off limit for HHcy. IR was determined using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2-IR) using the Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit calculator ( http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk ; University of Oxford, UK). (HOMA2-IR: (fasting insulin×fasting glucose)/22.5). Patients with HOMA2-IR greater than 2.1 were classified as IR  [25] . Outcome of the pregnancy was recorded at the end of the gestational period. Women who did not attend the clinic were contacted by telephone or letter to document information about the outcome of their pregnancy.
Development of the probabilistic model
A probabilistic model has been developed to compare the variables and their relationships with the help of bayesian network for diagnosis of RPL. The selected database available to us included 243 records where each of the records was described by four (PCOS, BMI, HOMA2-IR and HHcy) different features established as causal factor for miscarriage, which are binary in nature denoting presence or absence of a feature. The model consisted of eight nodes and each node corresponding to a variable namely fasting insulin, post prandial (PP) insulin, PP blood sugar, fasting blood sugar, HOMA2-IR, Hcy, BMI and PCOS. A dependency structure has been developed to correlate the association of IR, HHcy, PCOS and obesity with RPL in single or in combination. Since the above pathologies are influenced by fasting insulin, PP insulin, PP blood sugar and fasting blood sugar, hence all these relationships were incorporated in the model. The structure of the proposed model is shown in  Figure 2 . After initialization of all conditional probability densities with a uniform distribution, an expectation maximization algorithm was run to estimate the parameters from this given data for the above probabilistic graphical model. After the estimation process is over, we obtained the estimated parameters from the model and computed the probability distribution given by the data.
Statistical Analyses
The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to test the normality of distribution. All results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, unless otherwise stated. Differences between the two groups were evaluated with use of analysis of variance and chi-square test, as applicable. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to calculate correlation between paired data sets.
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis and SAMIAM software available at  http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/samiam/  (University of California, Los Angles, U.S.A.) was used for the development of the model. The accuracy of the model was analysed by using a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) and the area under this curve (AUC). Statistical significance was considered present if the P-value was less than 0.05, unless stated otherwise.
This retrospective study was conducted at Institute of Reproductive Medicine, Kolkata, a referral centre for the treatment and management of infertility and O&G complications. Patients were selected from the women attending the infertility clinic from March 2008 through February 2011. During this period, data of four hundred and sixty five women were approached for the study. Two hundred and ninety one PCOS women as diagnosed in accordance with the Rotterdam criteria  [23]  and two hundred and four non- PCOS subjects form the total cohort. Two hundred and twenty seven PCOS and one hundred forty one non-PCOS subjects gave written informed consent and were initially enrolled. PCOS was diagnosed if at least two of the following criteria were present: oligo/amenorrhoea, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCO on USG. Other common causes of hyperandrogenism (prolactinoma, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cushing syndrome and virilizing ovarian/adrenal tumors) were excluded. The selection of the patient cohort in the PCOS arm was based on the exclusion criteria: ultrasonography (USG)-documented uterine anatomical anomalies, chromosomal defects as evaluated by peripheral blood karyotyping of both partners, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, positive tests for APS (lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibodies), infections including Toxoplasma gondii, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus, and unavailability of relevant clinical and laboratory data. One hundred and twenty six women met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-four subjects were excluded from the non-PCOS arm on the basis of uterine anomalies, hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes mellitus and unavailability of relevant laboratory data. The non-PCOS group of one-hundred and seventeen subjects were represented mostly by those with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage, but also included 3 women who had their miscarriages attributed to male factors. All the three women had infertility due to oligo- or oligoasthenozoospermia. They had their pregnancies by assisted reproductive technology (ART) using husband's semen but experienced loss of pregnancies in all occasions. However, subsequent analysis demonstrated sperm chromosome aneuploidy (>40%) in all the three male partners. They had normal ovulatory cycles (mean ± S.D) of 28±2 days and normal ovarian morphology on ultrasound. ( Figure 1 ). Percentage of pregnancy loss was evaluated with respect to their specific phenotypes. For the present investigation RPL has been defined as two or more spontaneous abortions before 20 weeks of gestation  [1] . The body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the Quintelet formula (weight in kg/height in meters squared) and was considered obese if BMI>30 kg/m 2  according to the World Health Organization  [24] .
