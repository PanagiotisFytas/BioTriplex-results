Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as two or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20 th  week of pregnancy is a frequent obstetric complication  [1] . While parental chromosomal anomalies, maternal thrombophilic disorders, uterine structural anomalies and anti-phospholipid antibodies have been directly associated with recurrent miscarriage, in almost 50% of cases the pathophysiology remains unknown  [2] . Among the undetermined cases, genetic predisposition to venous thrombosis  [3]  caused by heritable thrombophilic defects and elevation in total homocysteine (tHcy) levels (hyperhomocysteinemia; HHcy) or combinations of these two pathologic conditions have been described as playing a role in the pathogenesis of RPL  [4] ,  [5] . Moreover, HHcy may lead to premature vascular disease, i.e., early damage to decidual or chorionic vessels that may cause disturbed implantation of the conceptus  [6] .However, until now, reports on this topic are actually not univocal  [7] ,  [8] .
The clinical association of RPL in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is more than common. However, the incidence rate between PCOS and recurrent miscarriage remains uncertain due to its wide variation in different studies  [9] ,  [10] ,  [11] ,  [12] . The high prevalence of hyper-secretion of LH  [13]  and obesity  [14]  in the syndrome contributes to the conclusion which has been reported as a risk factor for spontaneous abortion. Hyperinsulinemia has been proposed as the pathway for the effect of obesity on some reproductive abnormalities, probably through its effect on androgen production. One school of thought has pointed out insulin resistance (IR), an integral pathogenetic feature in the heterogeneous entity as a key factor behind the link between PCOS/obesity and the risk of RPL  [15] ,  [16] . Furthermore, a number of studies document a possible association between IR and HHcy  [17]  with incidence of the latter being increasingly a frequent finding in PCOS women  [18] . Recent reports attest the occurrence of hypofibronolysis associated with high plasminogen activator inhibitor -1(PAI-1) in women with PCOS for the reason of RPL  [19] ,  [20] . The effects of elevated PAI-1 may also be aggravated by elevated homocysteine  [21] , eventually causing thrombosis. Furthermore, plasma PAI-1 levels are associated with dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia and hypertension which play three essential connecting links in cases with HHcy  [22] . Thus, PCOS involves several confounding factors that may contribute, individually or in combination, to thrombosis and eventually lead to RPL. The association of IR, HHcy and obesity in individual with increased miscarriage rates has already been established. However, an effect of IR on HHcy or vice-versa has often been a hindrance to specify the superiority of the any of the variable over the other. In this study, we assessed the relationship between elevated levels of homocysteine and IR noting the effect of BMI in women with RPL, and evaluated the correlation, if any, of these factors with the reproductive outcome in these women.
