Previous research found various immune evasion pathways in lymphomas, persuading that deception from antitumor immunity was required for the pathogenesis of lymphoma [ 66 ]. PD-L1/PD-1 signaling is one way cancers bypass the immune system [ 67 ]. PD-L1/PD-1 signaling has a major role in lymphocyte malfunction. However, anti-PDL1/PD-1 antibodies do not consistently reverse this mechanism, suggesting that other molecules may contribute to lymphocyte depletion [ 68 ]. The study assessed PD-L1/PD-1 expression in circulating CXCR3 and CD36-positive lymphocytes in lymphoma.
In this study, the percentage of peripheral CXCR3 and CD36 positive lymphocytes differed significantly between lymphoma patients and healthy controls. In earlier studies, investigations revealed that CXCR3 expression was restricted to activated T lymphocytes [ 69 ] and that CXCR3 and CD36 expression was detected in small percentages of peripheral lymphocytes [ 33 ,  70 ]. Other studies found that individuals with various forms of lymphoma had a higher percentage of peripheral CD36 and CXCR3+ lymphocytes, implying that lymphoma patients have an immunological defect [ 71 ,  72 ].
PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in peripheral lymphocytes has not been studied in lymphoma. In lymphomas, coexpression was observed in peripheral lymphocytes but not healthy controls. A prior study revealed high PD-1/PD-L1expression in subjects with tumors than in healthy controls [ 73 ]. PD-L1 expression was associated with CD36 expression [ 74 ], and its enhancement was via CXCR3 in an Akt and STAT3-dependent manner [ 75 ]. The findings presuppose that CXCR3/CD36 and PDL1/PD-1 coexpression have a crucial role in lymphoma development, suggesting using this coexpression as a diagnostic test in managing lymphoma.
A significant increase in PD-1+CXCR3+% and PD-1+CXCR3+% was observed in subjects with extranodal involvement than in patients without extranodal involvement, giving evidence for the association between these cells and extranodal involvement's pathogenesis. CXCR3 expression in peripheral lymphocytes might fluctuate with the clinical outcome as T cell activation and differentiation regulates its expression [ 76 ]. The results might be the outcome of the immune system and lymphoma interaction, assuming that PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3 positive lymphocytes is engaged in tumor invasion and extranodal involvement in lymphoma. Another scenario might be due to the PD-L1+CXCR3 and PD-1+CXCR3 cell-mediated tolerance state, enabling extranodal involvement in lymphoma. PD-L1 and CXCR3 expressions were associated with tumor progression and a worse prognosis [ 67 ,  77 ].
High percentages of circulating PD+L1+CD36+ and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes were found in lymphoma subjects with extranodal involvement. CD36 contributed to tumor growth and progression [ 35 ] and was associated with PD-L1 expression [ 74 ]. Moreover, CD36 induced reprogramming of the lipid uptake in tumor cells, tumorigenesis, and metastasis [ 78 ]. CD36 blocking might be a potential new lymphoma therapy [ 79 ]. CD36 can attach to transmembrane proteins on the surface of cells, such as PD-L1/PD-1, which might induce signal transduction and ligand binding. Lymphoma progression and extranodal involvement in lymphomas could be initiated by PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CD36.
The findings revealed that lymphoma patients' peripheral CXCR3-positive lymphocytes have high PD-L1/PD-1 expression levels. CXCR3+PD-L1+%, on the other hand, was 5-6 times higher than CXCR3+PD-1+%. The data reveal that PD-L1, but not PD-1, is involved in lymphoma emergence by mediating extranodal involvement, assuming that PD-L1 might be the most significant molecule in the extranodal involvement of lymphoma. Previous studies demonstrated that CXCL10 could activate the p44/42 ERK and Akt signaling pathways and activate p38 MAPK in T lymphocytes, enhancing apoptosis [ 80 ]. According to the findings, the negative PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in circulating lymphocytes might be via CXCR3 or CD36. Another scenario is that CXCR3 and CD36 might increase PD-L1/PD-1 expression, enhancing CXCR3/CD36 and PD-L1/PD-1 crosstalk. The coexpression of these molecules may act as inhibitory molecules by inducing lymphocyte apoptosis, which may be linked to the pathogenesis and etiology of lymphoma extranodal involvement. PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 could significantly impact clinical lymphoma activity.
In lymphoma patients without extranodal involvement, posttherapy PD-L1/PD-1 and CXCR3/CD36 coexpression were reduced, suggesting that chemotherapy might induce a disruption in PD-1/PD-L1 signaling. In patients who had achieved remission, PD-L1 expression was reduced [ 81 ]. By reducing PD-1 expression in peripheral lymphocytes and enhancing the immune response, chemotherapy may serve as an effective antitumor treatment [ 82 ]. Chemotherapy may increase the nuclear expression of PD-1/PD-L1 while decreasing the surface expression [ 83 ]. Low PD-L1/PD-1+CD36 percentages promote peripheral cell proliferation, providing a possible antitumor mechanism in lymphoma. The findings assumed that the relevance of immune cells in antitumor immunity could be determined by the decline in PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR/CD36 in peripheral lymphocytes.
Compared to healthy controls, sera from lymphoma patients had a higher concentration of IL-19. The findings appeared to be consistent with prior studies that showed an elevation of IL-19 in patients with NHL compared to normal controls [ 42 ]. IL-19 levels were associated with high LDH levels. High LDH levels were associated with inferior prognosis in lymphoma [ 84 ]. In the current study, patients with extranodal involvement had significantly higher IL-19 levels than patients without extranodal involvement. Previous studies revealed IL-19 association with tumor metastasis and poor clinical outcomes [ 43 ,  44 ]. This refers to the significance of employing IL-19 to identify extranodal involvement, implying earlier treatment and increased endurance.
CXCR3+ and PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes were significantly associated with high LDH levels. Furthermore, these cells were negatively associated with albumin levels, which agreed with previous reports [ 85 ]. This observation suggested a key role for CXCR3+, PD-L1+CXCR3+, and PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes in lymphoma pathogenesis and progression.
The results indicated that CXCR3+, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes were associated with poor prognostic features such as hepatomegaly, staging, splenomegaly, and recurrence. Previous studies reported the high expression of CXCR3, and PD-L1/PD-1 was related to cancer invasion [ 86 – 90 ]. PD-L1+CXCR3+ and PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes might be involved in inferior prognosis in lymphoma.
In this current study, some clinical criteria were significantly associated with high IL-19 levels. Pretherapy IL-19 levels were significantly associated with both hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Moreover, IL-19 levels had a significant correlation with lymphedema and recurrence. Previous studies showed the association between high IL-19 levels and inferior clinical outcomes [ 44 ], assuming a major role for IL-19 in lymphoma progression.
Bone marrow, lung, and lymph vessel involvement were positively correlated with CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% of cells. PD-L1+CXCR3+ cells majorly mediate the metastasis of melanoma and colon carcinoma [ 23 ,  24 ]. Interestingly, PD-L1+CD36+ and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes mediate lung and bone marrow involvement. Lymphoma prognosis is closely associated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement [ 3 ,  91 ]. To our knowledge, these findings have not been reported before. PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3+ cells might represent a novel and critical prognostic marker as their expression was related to extranodal involvement and prognosis. A possible scenario is that PD-L1 and CXCR3 function as immune-suppressive agents in cancer [ 92 ,  93 ].
This study revealed that high IL-19 levels were associated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement. In former studies, IL-19 levels were related to poor prognosis and metastasis [ 94 ]. Interestingly, an association between lung involvement and higher serum IL-19 levels was observed in lymphoma. According to the findings, IL-19 could be a biomarker for extranodal lymphoma involvement.
This study linked high percentages of PD-L1+CXCR3+, PD-1+CXCR3+, and high IL-19 levels to shorter EFS. The results also assume that posttherapy PDL1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+ percentages are correlated with poor prognosis, considering prognostic biomarkers in lymphoma patients. High expression of PD-1/PD-1 is confined to poor prognosis in lymphoma [ 95 ]. PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19 might play an inferior prognostic role in lymphoma, providing a new significant era in lymphoma immunotherapy, especially in patients with extranodal involvement.
PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in identifying patients with extranodal involvement was assessed using ROC curves. The AUCs of the pre- and posttherapy PD-L1+CXCR3+% were 0.981 and 0.961, respectively, with high specificity and sensitivity. The cut-off values were >33 and >40. CXCR3+% and PD-L1+CXCR3+% yielded the best sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the ROC curve was assessed for posttherapy PD-L1/PD-1+CD36+ percentages. The AUCs were 0.694 and 0.769, with reduced sensitivity and specificity. Thus, according to the findings, PD-L1/PD-1+CD36+% is insufficient for identifying extranodal involvement in lymphoma patients. Furthermore, the pretherapy IL-19 ROC curves demonstrated a pattern of extranodal involvement ( AUC  = 0.993 and  P  < 0.001). The specificity and sensitivity were 97.73% and 100% at a cut-off >280 pg/mL.
This study had some limitations: (1) the small size of the subjects in this study; (2) short follow-up time, longer follow-up, and multicenter collaborations are needed to confirm PD-L1/PD-1's role; (3) PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 should be investigated in tumor tissue; (4) cell function activities such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and cytokine release were not carried out; future research will investigate these issues; (5) PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 was not investigated in different lymphocyte subsets; further studies are required.
In conclusion, PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and serum IL-19 may be involved in lymphoma extranodal involvement and have prognostic and predictive values in lymphoma. The findings could also shed light on the role of circulating CXCR3 and CD36-positive lymphocyte cells in lymphoma. Future clinical trials and research are required to create new treatments based on PD-L1/PD-1-induced lymphoma immune evasion mechanisms and host immune response regulation. The combination of PD-L1/PD-1 blockades, anti-CXCR3/CD36, and IL-19 monoclonal antibody therapy might start a new era for immunotherapy. PD-L1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes and serum IL-19 might play a more important role in poor clinical behavior in lymphoma.
