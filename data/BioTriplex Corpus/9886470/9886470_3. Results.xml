3.1. Subjects
The study included 50 healthy individuals and 78 lymphoma patients. Normal controls included thirty-six males and fourteen females. Healthy volunteers ranged in age from 24 to 81 years old. Seventy-eight lymphoma subjects ranged in age from 11 to 81 years, including 39 males and 39 females. The criteria for all subjects are listed in (Supplementary Table  1 ).
After therapy and follow-up, there were 34 lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement and 44 without extranodal involvement. Patients with extranodal involvement had a mean age of 42.81 ± 7.6, ranging from 11 to 81, while those without extranodal involvement had a mean age of 42 ± 16.1, ranging from 18 to 75. Supplementary Table  2  reveals no significant differences regarding age, lymphoma types, and subtypes between patients without extranodal involvement ( N  = 34) and patients with extranodal involvement ( N  = 34). Lymphoma patients with and without extranodal involvement revealed statistical significance regarding sex ( P  = 0.039), stage ( P  < 0.001), recurrence ( P  < 0.001), and death ( P  = 0.018). Among lymphoma subjects with extranodal involvement, 73.5% had a recurrence, and 20.6% died. 26.5% of patients with extranodal involvement presented with stage III diseases, while 58.8% had stage IV diseases. Only 2.9% of patients with extranodal involvement had stage I, and 11.8% had stage II (Supplementary Table  2 ).
The different extranodal involvement sites in lymphoma patients are shown in  Table 1 . Bone marrow involvement and lymph vessel infiltration were found in 33.3% and 21.8% of patients, respectively. 12.8% of patients presented with lung involvement, while approximately 10.3% had spleen infiltration. Furthermore, 9% of lymphoma patients showed liver involvement. Only 1.3% of patients had involvement of the intestine, thyroid, or central nervous system ( Table 1 ).
3.2. High PD-L1/PD-1 Expression in Circulating CD36+ and CXCR3+ Lymphocytes in Newly Diagnosed Lymphoma Patients
Flow cytometric analysis investigated CD36 and CXCR3 expression in peripheral lymphocytes in 78 newly diagnosed lymphoma patients and 50 healthy controls. Lymphocyte gating was shown in Supplementary Figures  1-4 . CD36 and CXCR3 positive lymphocytes were found in small percentages in healthy controls (median: 4.2% (range: 3.5–5.7) and median: 11.2% (range: 9.7–13.2)). High pretherapy CXCR3+% and CD36+% of cells were observed in lymphoma patients than in normal volunteers (median: 40% vs. 11.2%; 13% vs. 4.2%,  P  < 0.001) ( Table 2 ).
The study then examined whether peripheral CD36 and CXCR3 positive lymphocytes expressed PD-L1 and PD-1. Compared to healthy controls, newly diagnosed lymphoma patients had higher PD-L1+CXCR3+% and PD-1+CXCR3+% (32% vs. 1.1%; 10% vs. 0.7%,  P  < 0.001). Interestingly, PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% in newly diagnosed lymphoma subjects were significantly higher than in healthy volunteers (median: 8% vs. 1%; 5 vs. 0.2,  P  < 0.001) ( Table 2 ).
3.3. Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 with CXCR3+/CD36 Defines Extranodal Involvement in Lymphoma
Extranodal involvement of lymphoma indicates an inferior prognosis for lymphoma. PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in circulating lymphocytes was investigated in posttherapy lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement ( n  = 34) or without extranodal involvement ( n  = 44) ( Figure 1 ). Posttherapy 34 lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement were characterized by higher percentages of peripheral CXCR3 positive lymphocytes than those in posttherapy 44 patients without extranodal involvement (median: 78% vs. 26%,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 1 ). When considering circulating CD36+ lymphocytes, CD36+% was lower in extranodal involvement compared with subjects without extranodal involvement (median: 27% vs. 55.5%,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 1 ).
Lymphoma subjects with extranodal involvement had higher PD-L1+CXCR3+% and PD-1+CXCR3+% compared with subjects without extranodal involvement (median 65% vs. 4%; 12.2% vs. 2%,  P  < 0.001, respectively) (Figures  1(a) – 1(d) ). Furthermore, PD-L1+CD36% and PD-1+CD36+% were significantly higher in subjects with extranodal involvement compared with patients without extranodal involvement (median 22 vs. 8,  P  = 0.004; 5.8% vs. 1%,  P  < 0.001) (Figures  1(e) – 1(h) ).
A significant increase in posttherapy PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in circulating lymphocytes was detected in the extranodal involvement group compared with the pretherapy samples of the same group (Supplementary Table  3 ). However, lymphoma patients without extranodal involvement had a lower posttherapy PDL-1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 than in the pretherapy samples of the same patients (Supplementary Table  4 ).
3.4. IL-19 in Lymphoma Patients
Newly diagnosed 78 lymphoma patients had significantly higher IL-19 levels than normal volunteers (median = 237 vs. 7.2 pg/mL,  P  < 0.001). Moreover, lymphoma patients had higher posttherapy IL-19 levels than the normal controls (median: 219 vs. 7,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 2(a) ).
Posttherapy IL-19 levels were detected in lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement, and the median level was 628 pg/mL (range: 439-817.3), which was significantly higher than that of subjects without extranodal invasion with a median of 46.5 pg/mL (range: 33-137.5) ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure 2(b) ). Interestingly, compared to patients without extranodal involvement, lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement had higher pretherapy IL-19 levels (median: 525 vs. 100,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 2(b) ).
3.5. Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 with CXCR3+/CD36 and IL-19 Defines Lymphoma Clinical Outcome
Patients with CR had significantly lower pretherapy IL-19, CXCR3+%, and PD-L1+CXCR3+% compared to the PR, recurrence, and refractory groups ( P  < 0.05). Furthermore, compared to the PR, recurrence, and refractory groups, the CR group had a significant reduction in posttherapy IL-19, CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% ( P  < 0.05). Additionally, PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% were significantly lower in subjects with CR compared to the other groups. Contrarily, comparing the CR group to the other groups, there was a substantial rise in posttherapy CD36+% ( P  < 0.001,  P  < 0.001, and  P  = 0.010) ( Table 3 ).
The CR group showed a significant reduction in pretherapy PD-1+CXCR3+% and posttherapy PD-L1+CXCR3+% compared to the PR group and recurrence group ( P  < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed when subjects with CR were compared to the treatment-refractory patients ( P  = 0.092 and  P  = 0.055). In addition, the CR patients' PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+ % were significantly lower than those in the PR group ( P  = 0.037 and  P  = 0.002). However, no significant difference was detected between the CR group and the recurrence group or the refractory group ( P  > 0.05) ( Table 3 ).
Pretherapy IL-19 levels, CXCR3+%, and PD-L1+CXCR3+% in lymphoma patients with recurrence were statistically higher than in the PR patients ( P  < 0.001). Additionally, the recurrence group's posttherapy IL-19 levels, PD-L1+CXCR3+, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were significantly higher than those of PR patients ( P  = 0.018,  P  = 0.013, and  P  = 0.011) ( Table 3 ). Furthermore, pretherapy PD-1+CD36+% and posttherapy CD36+% in patients with recurrence were significantly lower than in PR patients ( P  = 0.022 and  P  = 0.002). However, no significant differences were observed when the treatment-refractory group compared to PR or recurrence groups ( P  > 0.05) ( Table 3 ).
3.6. Correlation between PDL-1/PD-1 Coexpression with CXCR3/CD36, IL-19, and Laboratory and Clinical Criteria
The results revealed a positive association between pretherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3%, and LDH ( r  = 0.344,  P  = 0.002;  r  = 0.375,  P  = 0.001;  r  = 0.315,  P  = 0.005, respectively). However, negative associations between CXCR3+%, PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3%, and albumin levels were identified ( r  = −0.269;  P  = 0.017;  r  = −0.326,  P  = 0.004;  r  = −0.337,  P  = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, there was a negative association between PD-L1+CXCR3+% and hemoglobin ( r  = −0.254,  P  = 0.025) ( Table 4 ).
CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were positively correlated with hepatomegaly ( r  = 0.464,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.398,  P  < 0.001,  r  = 0.335,  P  = 0.003). Data revealed that CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% positively correlated with lymphoma stages ( r  = 0.498,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.437,  P  < 0.001,  r  = 0.333,  P  = 0.002) ( Table 4 ). Moreover, CXCR3+% and PD-L1+CXCR3+% associated positively with both splenomegaly ( r  = 0.348,  P  = 0.002;  r  = 0.268,  P  = 0.018) and general lymphadenopathy ( r  = 0.362,  P  = 0.001;  r  = 0.304,  P  = 0.007). Furthermore, CXCR3+% and PD-L1+CXCR3+% positively correlated with BCR-ABL ( r  = 0.262,  P  = 0.020;  r  = 0.271,  P  = 0.016). Additionally, CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% had a significant association with lymphoma recurrence ( r  = 0.645,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.676,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.310,  P  = 0.006) ( Table 4 ). CD36+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CD36+% were associated with some of clinical parameters but without significance ( P  > 0.05) ( Table 4 ).
Interestingly, pretherapy IL-19 was positively correlated with LDH levels ( r  = 0.349 and  P  = 0.002), hepatomegaly ( r  = 0.362 and  P  = 0.001), and splenomegaly ( r  = 0.231 and  P  = 0.042). Furthermore, pretherapy IL-19 levels were significantly associated with lymphedema, general lymphadenopathy, and recurrence ( r  = 0.426,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.239,  P  = 0.035;  r  = 0.641,  P  < 0.001) ( Table 4 ).
3.7. Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 and CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19 Is Associated with Extranodal Involvement
Posttherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were positively associated with extranodal involvement ( r  = 0.771,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.793,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.528,  P  < 0.001). CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% had a positive association with bone marrow involvement ( r  = 0.645,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.676,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.369,  P  < 0.001). Moreover, CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were positively associated with lymph vessel involvement ( r  = 0.499,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.487,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.272,  P  = 0.016). Additionally, a significant association between CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, PD-1+CXCR3+%, and lung involvement was identified ( r  = 0.277,  P  = 0.014;  r  = 0.286,  P  = 0.011;  r  = 0.235,  P  = 0.038) ( Table 5 ).
Posttherapy PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-L1+CD36+% were positively correlated with extranodal involvement ( r  = 0.333,  P  = 0.003;  r  = 0.469,  P  < 0.001), while CD36+% had a negative association with extranodal involvement ( r  = −0.792 and  P  < 0.001). Of interest, PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% were positively correlated with bone marrow infiltration ( r  = 0.312,  P  = 0.005;  r  = 0.390,  P  < 0.001). PD-1+CD36+% was positively correlated with lung involvement ( r  = 0.234;  P  = 0.040). CD36% was negatively correlated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement ( r  = −0.633,  P  < 0.001;  r  = −0.386,  P  < 0.001). Furthermore, percentages of CD36+ lymphocytes were correlated with spleen infiltration ( r  = 0.327;  P  = 0.004) ( Table 5 ).
IL-19 concentrations and extranodal involvement were positively correlated ( r  = 0.848;  P  < 0.001). IL-19 levels are positively associated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement ( r  = 0.637,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.437,  P  < 0.001). Similarly, a positive association between posttherapy IL-19 levels and lung involvement was identified ( r  = 0.278;  P  = 0.014) ( Table 5 ).
3.8. Prognostic Value of PD-L1/PD-1 Coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19
The effect of the markers on EFS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier statistics ( Figure 3 ). Survival tree analysis identified that CXCR3+ and PD-L1+CXCR3+ staining percentages more than 50% were considered high, whereas those ≤50% were regarded as low staining. PD-1+CXCR3+ and PD-L1+CD36+ staining percentages more than 7% were considered high, whereas those ≤7% were regarded as low staining.
There was a high reduction in EFS in lymphoma patients with high percentages of pre- and posttherapy CXCR3+ lymphocytes ( P  < 0.001) (Figures  3(a)  and  3(e) ). Moreover, pre- and posttherapy PD-L1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes were negatively associated with EFS ( P  < 0.001) (Figures  3(b)  and  3(f) ). Patients' EFS was significantly decreased when their initial PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocyte percentages were high ( P  = 0.022) ( Figure 3(c) ). High pre-T IL-19 levels were associated with inferior EFS ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure 3(d) ). A prolonged EFS was predicted by low posttherapy PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% ( P  < 0.001) (Figures  3(g)  and  3(h) ).
The effect of the immune markers on overall survival and recurrence-free survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier statistics (data not shown). Patients with low pre- and posttherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXC3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% do better than those with a high percentage. Furthermore, low PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-L1+CD36+% predicted a more prolonged survival and recurrence-free time.
3.9. Diagnostic Utility of PD-L1/PD-1 Coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19 in Identifying Extranodal Involvement

 Figure 4  shows the ROC analysis for predicting extranodal involvement in lymphoma. Pretherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% could predict extranodal involvement with AUCs of 0.982, 0.981, and 0.764 (95% CI = 0.922 − 0.999; 0.921–0.999; 0.654-0.853;  P  < 0.001, respectively) (Figures  4(a) – 4(c) ). Pretherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% cut-offs were >41, >33, and >11, respectively. Moreover, pretherapy CXCR3+%, PDL-1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXC3+% sensitivities were 97.06%, 97.06%, and 61.67%, and the specificities were 97.73%, 97.73%, and 79.55%. Pretherapy CXCR3+% and PDL-1+CXCR3+ had the best sensitivity and specificity. Pretherapy IL-19 levels could predict extranodal involvement with an AUC of 0.909 (95% CI = 0.822 − 0.962,  P  < 0.001). The pretherapy IL-19 cut-off was >209 pg/mL, with specificity and sensitivity 75% and 91.18% ( Figure 4(d) ).
Posttherapy CXCR3+%, PDL-1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXC3+% could diagnose lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement. Posttherapy CXCR3+%, PDL-1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXC3+% AUCs were 0.949, 0.961, and 0.805 ( P  < 0.001) at a cutoff >49, >40, and >3, respectively (Figures  5(a) – 5(c) ). Posttherapy PD-1+CXCR3+% had the best sensitivity of 100%, while PD-L1+CXCR3+% and CXCR3+% had the best specificity of 100%.
Moreover, the AUC values of the posttherapy CD36+%, PDL-1+CD36+%, and PD-1+CD36+% for extranodal involvement diagnosis were 0.961, 0.694, and 0.769 (95% CI = 0.890 − 0.992; 0.579-0.793; 0.659-0.857, respectively). Posttherapy CD36+%, PDL-1+CD36+%, and PD-1+CD36+% had cutoff levels ≤37, > 11, and>3 ( P  < 0.001,  P  = 0.002, and  P  < 0.001). Posttherapy CD36+% had the best sensitivity of 100% and the best specificity of 95.45% (Figures  5(d) – 5(f) ).
The posttherapy IL-19 AUC was 0.993 (95% CI = 0.941–1.000,  P  < 0.001), with a cutoff >280 pg/mL for diagnosis of extranodal involvement. IL-19 showed 100% sensitivity and 97.73% specificity ( Figure 5(g) ).
