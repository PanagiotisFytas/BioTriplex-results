Annual publications and trend
A total of 1329 publications regarding NDDS for PC were included. As shown in  Figure 2 , in general, since 2008, the annual number of publications has exceeded 10 and increased over time. The number of publications of NDDS for PC was the highest in 2021, although there was a slight decline in volatility in some years (2011 and 2018). 1329 publications had a total of 57,431 citations, with an average of 43.21 citations per paper, and an H-index of 102.
Countries/regions
A total of 71 countries/regions contributed to the publications included. The United States had the largest number of publications ( n  = 456, accounting for 34.312% of the total; 25,009 citations, with an average of 54.84 citations per paper, and an H-index of 79), followed by China ( n  = 446, accounting for 33.559%; 15,117 citations, with an average of 33.89 citations per paper, and an H-index of 62), and India ( n  = 108, accounting for 8.126%; 4,071 citations, with an average of 37.69 citations per paper, and an H-index of 37) ( Figure 3A ). Although the total number of publications in France ranked fourth, its total number of citations was second only to the United States and China, and its average number of citations was higher than that of the United States.  Figure 3B  summarized the annual output trend of the top 3 productive countries from 2003 to 2021.  Figures 3C,D  showed international cooperation among countries.  Figure 3C  was generated by CiteSpace: The thickness of the lines between countries showed the strength of cooperation. Among the top 20 countries with the most papers, the United States and China had the closest cooperation with other countries/regions; The United States, European countries (e.g., Italy and France), and Asian countries (e.g., China, India, and Saudi Arabia) were still the most important part of the national cooperation map, and extensive cooperative relations have been established between them, but the cooperation of other developing countries was still weak. In addition, cooperation in neighboring regions (e.g., the United States and Canada; China and Japan, South Korea), intra-continental cooperation (e.g., Germany and Spain, England, and Italy), and inter-continental cooperation (e.g., China and the United States) were also observed.
Institutions
A total of 1,600 institutions worldwide contributed to the 1329 publications related to NDDS for PC. CiteSpace generated a cooperation network of institutions, as shown in  Figure 4 . The top 5 institutions with the most papers were Chinese Acad Sci, Fudan Univ, Zhejiang Univ, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, and Univ Chinese Acad Sci. The betweenness centrality (BC) value was an index to evaluate the importance of nodes in a collaborative network, and a BC value >0.1 was considered a vital node ( Cheng et al., 2022b ). Among the top 22 institutions with the most publications, institutions with BC values greater than 0.1 included Chinese Acad Sci (0.27), Harvard Med Sch (0.11), and Univ Sci and Technol China (0.11). Among these 22 institutions, China had 10 institutions, and the United States had 8 institutions ( Table 1 ).

Authors and co-cited authors
In terms of an author analysis, the total citations (×100), average citation per paper (×10), and H-index of the top five most prolific authors were shown in  Figure 5A . Couvreur P contributed the most publications, followed by Kataoka K and Yong KT. The publications of Couvreur P had the highest total and average citations (4976 and 248.8, respectively), and the H-index is 14; The total and average citations of publications by Kataoka K ranked second (3784 and 189.2 respectively), with the highest H-index ( n  = 19); Although the number of publications by Meng H ranked fifth, the total and average number of citations of which ranked third (1918 and 137 respectively).  Figure 5B  showed the number of publications by the top five most prolific authors in different years and the total citations per year: It could be seen that the total citations of the six papers by Couvreur P in 2013 exceeded 1000 ( n  = 4,306), the total citations of two papers by Kataoka K in 2011 exceeded 1000 ( n  = 1,870), and one article by Meng H in 2009 was cited 687 times in total.  Figure 5C  showed the cluster density map of author co-authorship analysis. Only 158 authors with more than 5 papers were included, forming a total of 9 author clusters. By analyzing the co-citation network of authors, 85 authors who have been cited more than 45 times were defined as key researchers ( Figure 5D ): The connection represented the cooperation between authors, and the size of the circle represented the number of citations. Total link strength (TLS) indicated the impact of authors’ published papers on other authors involved in the studies. Meng H had the greatest TLS ( n  = 2134), followed by Von Hof DD ( n  = 1597), and Maeda H ( n  = 1582).
Journals
329 journals published 1329 publications regarding NDDS for PC, and 66 journals published more than 5 publications. Among the top 16 journals in terms of the number of papers,  JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE  ranked first (58 papers), followed by  BIOMATERIALS  and  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE  (52 and 44 papers, respectively) ( Table 2 ;  Figure 6A ). Among these 16 journals, 5 were published in the Netherlands, 5 were published in England, and 3 in the United States. The papers of  ACS NANO  had the highest total number of citations ( n  = 4,110), followed by  BIOMATERIALS  ( n  = 3,294), and  JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE  ( n  = 2,577). According to the latest JCR division in 2021, 13 journals were in JCR Q1 and 3 journals were in JCR Q2, and  ACS NANO  was the journal with the highest impact factor. In addition, we also conducted the map of annual occurrences of the top 16 journals, to more specifically understand the changing trend of the number of publications of these journals in different years ( Figure 6B ). As shown in  Figure 6C , the network visualization diagram of journal co-citation analysis was created by VOSviewer. Only visually cite journals at least 300 times. Among the 59 journals that met the standard, the top 5 journals commonly cited were  JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE ,  BIOMATERIALS ,  ACS NANO ,  CANCER RESEARCH,  and  ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS .

Dual-map overlays of nano drug delivery system for pancreatic cancer
The superposition of dual-map overlays revealed the overall scientific contribution. The left side was the citing journal, the right side was the cited journal, and the colored line path represented the citation relationship, indicating the citation trajectory and knowledge flow of knowledge ( Chen and Leydesdorff, 2014 ). The result indicated that the citing papers regarding NDDS for PC were mainly focused on journals in the field of molecular, biology, immunology, and physics, materials, chemistry, whereas most of the cited articles were published in journals in the field of molecular, biology, genetics, and chemistry, materials, physics ( Figure 7 ).
Co-cited references and the strongest citation burst

 Table 3  summarized the top 10 highly co-cited references of NDDS for PC research. The visualization network of co-cited references by CiteSpace were shown in  Figure 8A . In the visualization network of co-cited references, all nodes representing the references were clustered into 17 specific clusters with the highest K values, including “#0 tumor penetration”, “#1 gemcitabine”, “#2 exosome”, and “#3 pancreatic stellate cells”, and so on. The timeline view could help us understand the evolution track of this field ( Liu et al., 2021b ). Visualized timeline for these 17 clusters was further performed ( Figure 8B ), and we found that “half generation PAMAM dendrimer” and “lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticle” were earlier fields on NDDS for PC. In addition, we also applied CiteSpace to identify the top 30 references with the strongest citation burst. References citation burst refers to references that have been widely cited by other studies over a period of time, which meant that they have received special attention in a certain period ( Min et al., 2022 ). As shown in  Figure 8C , since 2008, the strongest citation burst came from the paper of Von HOFFDD et al. ( Von Hoff et al., 2013 ) in 2013, followed by the article of Bray F et al. on  CA-CANCER J CLIN  in 2018 ( Bray et al., 2018 ), and the article of Siegel RL et al. on  CA-CANCER J CLIN  in 2015 ( Siegel et al., 2015 ).

Keywords

 Figures 9A,B  show the network visualization of keywords generated by VOSviewer. Among 2713 keywords, the frequency of occurrence was set to at least 8, and finally, 82 keywords were included in the analysis.  Figure 9B  showed the overlay visualization of author keywords. Earlier keywords were displayed in blue, while orange represented the most recent keywords. For example, keywords such as “angiogenesis”, “EGFR”, and “controlled release” were the main topics in the early stage, and the keywords of “exosome”, “hypoxia”, “autophagy”, “tumor penetration”, and “immunotherapy” were hot topics in recent years. In addition, the distribution map of 35 high-frequency keywords over time was conducted by R software ( Figure 10A ), in which each cell represented the occurrence frequency of a keyword in a year, and the corresponding value was formed after standardizing these occurrences frequencies (0–1). The value of the black cell was the smallest, which represented the lowest occurrence frequency of the keyword this year, with the change of color, the value of the yellow cell was the biggest, and its corresponding keywords appeared the most frequently this year. For example, from 2002 to 2022 (as of September 8), “Magnetic resonance imaging” appeared more frequently in 2017, while in 2020 and 2021, the frequency decreased for two consecutive years.
The trend topic analysis was an important mapping tool that helped to portray the seed of trend integration rooted in the previous stream ( Dai et al., 2022 ). The trend topics map was generated by R-Bibliometrix based on the occurrence frequency of author keywords and set word minimum frequency = 15 and the number of words per year = 6 ( Figure 10B ). The results showed that the duration of “apoptosis” was the longest (8 years), followed by “magnetic nanoparticle” (7 years). “Immunotherapy” began to appear in the field of NDDS for PC in 2020, and “exosome” began to appear in the field in 2019. “Immunotherapy” had the highest frequency in 2021, while “exosome”, “tumor microenvironment”, and “photodynamic therapy” had the highest frequency in 2020.
Finally, the keywords thematic map was generated by R-Bibliometrix ( Figure 10C ), and a total of 260 keywords were examined where a minimum cluster frequency was 6 and the number of labels for each cluster was 10. The upper right quadrant (motor theme), which was characterized by a high density and centrality, showed probably the well-developed and important themes for the structuring of the NDDS for PC research field. The cluster included “tumor microenvironment”, “siRNA”, “combination therapy”, “targeted therapy”, “drug resistance”, “immunotherapy”, “hyaluronic acid”, “tumor targeting”, “miRNA”, and “cancer stem cell”. The upper-left quadrant (niche theme) contained two clusters, cluster one included “cancer-associated fibroblasts” and “extracellular matrix”; cluster two included “anticancer activity”, “pegylation”, and “reactive oxygen species”. The cluster in the third quadrant (emerging or declining theme) was characterized by low centrality and density, which means that it was weakly developed and marginal, including “erlotinib” and “hypoxia” as the major themes. The fourth quadrant (basic themes) contained two clusters, cluster one included “pancreatic cancer”, “nanoparticle”, “drug delivery system”, “gemcitabine”, “nanomedicine”, “cancer”, “cancer therapy”, “liposome”, “targeted drug delivery”, and “chemotherapy”; cluster two included “magnetic nanoparticle”, “mesoporous silica nanoparticle”, “photodynamic therapy”, “magnetic resonance imaging”, “photothermal therapy”, “theranostics”, “nanomaterial”, “active targeting”, “EGFR”, and “cisplatin”. They concern general topics that were transversal to different research areas of the field.
