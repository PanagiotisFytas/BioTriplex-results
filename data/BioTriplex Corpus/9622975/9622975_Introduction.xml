As an extremely malignant digestive system tumor, pancreatic cancer (PC) has atypical clinical symptoms ( Strobel et al., 2019 ), progresses rapidly, and lacks sensitive biomarkers for early diagnosis ( Siegel et al., 2019 ), resulting in more than 80% of PC patients being in advanced stage at the initial diagnosis and missing the opportunity of surgical resection ( Xie et al., 2018 ). At present, the efficacy of commonly used chemotherapy schemes, such as FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, is still limited ( Kielaite-Gulla et al., 2022 ). The main reasons that hinder these chemotherapy drugs from significantly improving the prognosis of the patients are the biological complexity and heterogeneity of PC ( Fan et al., 2017 ), the poor specificity of chemotherapy drugs, uneven distribution in the body, and side effects on normal tissues and organs ( Peng et al., 2017 ), and chemotherapy resistance of PC ( Stott et al., 2022 ). The clinical application of immunotherapy also faces challenges: first, the human immune system is difficult to accurately distinguish tumor cells from normal cells, resulting in “targeted extra tumor” toxicity ( Yilmaz et al., 2020 ); Secondly, the complex immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors prevents intravenous infusion of immune cells or cytokines from reaching the tumor site ( Lu et al., 2021 ).
Therefore, finding an ideal biocompatible targeted drug delivery system to overcome the above difficulties has become a research hotspot ( Lammers et al., 2012 ). Nanomaterial has a small volume, large surface area ( Rai et al., 2021 ), high permeability, can be effectively combined with a variety of biological materials to improve their biocompatibility, and can effectively control drug release ( Chen et al., 2016 ). Therefore, a nano-drug delivery system (NDDS) can protect encapsulated drugs from blood circulation degradation, target drug delivery, reduce systemic toxicity, improve drug solubility, and improve drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy ( Kaushik et al., 2022 ). NDDS works best in areas where many limitations exist with molecular targeted therapy, and a need exists to push treatment boundaries for PC ( Kokkinos et al., 2020 ).
Currently, bibliometrics has become a very important methodology for scholars to effectively identify the latest progress in a certain research field, predict research hotspots, and evaluate the development trend of this field. In recent years, bibliometrics has been applied to the research field related to nanomaterials ( Huang et al., 2015 ;  Zhu et al., 2021 ;  Huang et al., 2022 ). However, there is still a lack of bibliometric analysis of the application of nanomaterials in oncology in the face of the research trend of oncology, materials science, pharmacology, and other disciplines gradually interpenetrating. As far as we know, there was no bibliometric analysis of NDDS for PC at present. In this study, based on the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database, we used CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and R-Bibliometrix to conduct bibliometric and visual analysis on the number of publications, citations, and research trends of countries/regions, institutions, authors, and keywords in NDDS for PC related literature, and sorted out the research hotspots and predicted the development trends in this field.
