Cell culture
Ovarian cancer cell lines, SKOV3, OVCAR3, Hey and UACC1598 were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone; Logan, UT), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). HEK293 FT cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and geneticin at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml.
Lentiviral vector production
The lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 nickase-mediated BIRC5 gene editing vectors were constructed by annealing four gRNA oligonucleotide pairs and subcloning them in the BsmII site of lentiviral vector Lentiguide-puro vector (#52963, Addgene), and gRNAs were driven by human U6 promoter. Two gRNA sequences, 5’CGGGTCCCGCGATTCAAATC and 5’AGAGGTGGCGGCGGCGGCAT, were designed. CRISPRcas9 nickase was in a separate vector, LentiCas9-blast (#52962, Addgene) and driven by EF1a promoter. Lentiviral BIRC5 overexpression vector was purchased from Applied Biological Materials Inc (Richmond, Canada). Lentivirus was produced by packaging in 293FT cells, as published previously [ 46 ]. Stable cell lines were generated by transducing the SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells with the lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 nickase-mediated BIRC5 gene editing and lentiCas9-blast Cas9 nickase vectors and selected with 5 μg/ml puromycin or 10ug/ml blasticidin. LentiCas9-blast was used as the control vector without gRNAs.
Surveyor mutation assay
Genomic DNA was extracted from SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells transduced with lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 nickase BIRC5 and control vectors. PCR was performed by amplifying the mutated region. The primer pairs used to detect BIRC5 mutations were 5’TGCCTAGGCCTCTCAAAGTG and 5’AAGACTTACATGGGGTCGTCA in surveyor mutation assay. PCR product was denatured and reannealed with the PCR program: 95°C denatured for 5 min, ramped down to 85°C at -2°C/s and then ramped down to 25°C at -0.1°C/s; held at 4°C. Afterwards, 10 units of T7 endonuclease I was added and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of 0.25M EDTA and then visualized on a 1.2% agarose gel.
MTT assay
SKOV3 or OVCAR3 cells (8000/well) transduced with lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 nickase for BIRC5 editing and control vectors were plated into 96-well plates and cultured at different time points (24,48 and 72h). Thereafter, 10 μl of MTT reagent was added to each well and incubated for ∼4 h and then terminated by adding 100 μl detergent reagent to incubate at 22°C in the dark for 2 h. Cell proliferation was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm wavelength.
Cell clonogenic survival assay
400 BIRC5 knockout and control SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells or wild type cells treated with YM155 or vehicle were seeded on 6-well plates and cultured for 2 weeks and then fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with crystal blue. Colonies were counted for statistical analysis in triplicate.
Cell migration assay
The cell migration assay was performed using a modified transwell chamber (BD Falcon™, San Jose, CA). These chambers were inserted into 24-well cell culture plates. SKOV3 or OVCAR3 cells transduced with lentiviral BIRC5 Cas9 nickase gRNAs and control vectors (3 × 10 4 ) in 300 μl serum-free DMEM were added to the upper chamber. DMEM containing 10% FBS (serving as the chemoattractant) was added into the lower chamber of each well and incubated for 24 h. The medium and nonmigrated cells in the upper chamber were removed, while the migrated cells on the lower side of the membranes were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet. Pictures were taken at 10X magnification, and cells from at least three different fields were counted.
Cell invasion assay
SKOV3 and OVCAR3 (5 × 10 5 ) cells transduced with lentiviral BIRC5 gRNA and control vectors were seeded in serum-free DMEM onto inserts precoated with Matrigel (BD BioCoat™ using 24-well Tumor Invasion System (BD BioSciences, San Jose, CA). DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to the bottom chamber of the invasion system as the chemoattractant. The transwell inserts were stained for 5 min with hematoxylin and eosin following methanol fixation for 20 min following overnight incubation. Pictures were taken at 10X magnification. Invaded cells were counted in at least three different fields.
Immunofluorescent staining
To detect survivin gene expression, ovarian serous carcinoma sections were antigen-retrieved and incubated with blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS) for 1 h. The slides were incubated overnight with primary antibodies to survivin (1:200 dilution, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). After rinsing three times for 5 min with PBST, Alexa 488- or 594- conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) antibodies were added for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc.; Burlingame, CA). Images were captured on a Zeiss LSM700 laser scanning confocal microscope.
Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry
Tissue microarray (TMA) including 10 cases of high grade serous ovarian cancer tumors and 10 cases of normal fallopian tubes was prepared at Northwestern University Pathological Core Facility. TMA were sectioned at 4 μm in thickness. TMA slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. After antigen retrieval, all immunohistochemical staining was performed on a Ventana Nexus automated system. In brief, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3 % hydrogen peroxide. After blocking in 1.5 % normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature, slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-survivin (1:250) in a humid chamber. Staining was detected with I-View 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) detection system. Semi-quantitative immunointensity was scored in carcinoma tumor cells and normal fallopian epithelial cells as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) and 3 (strong) and percentage was showed as %.
Cell apoptosis
Stable SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cancer cell lines established with lentiviral BRIC5 gRNA and control vectors were treated with the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel at different doses (0, 20, 40 nM) for 24 h. Apoptosis was measured using a caspase3/7 activity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell apoptosis was also detected in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells transduced with lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 nickase-mediated BIRC5 gRNAs and control vectors by using Western blot by detecting cleaved PARP and active caspase 3.
Western blot
Ovarian cancer cells were collected in RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific; Rockford, IL) containing 1% Halt Proteinase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific; Rockford, IL). An equal amount of protein (40 μg/lane) was loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies against PDCD4 (Cell Signaling), GAPDH (Sigma; St. Louis, MO), vimentin, E-cadherin, or snail2 (Cell Signaling), cytokeratin-7.
Statistical analysis
Significant differences were determined from at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate and presented as means ± SD by using Student’s  t- test.  P  < 0.05 was considered significant.
