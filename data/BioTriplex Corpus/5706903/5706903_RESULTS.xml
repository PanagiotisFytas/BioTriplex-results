BIRC5 was highly expressed in ovarian cancer and associated with poor survival in patients
To examine the expression level of BIRC5 in ovarian cancer, we analyzed TCGA datasets that included 586 serous ovarian carcinomas and 8 normal ovary controls [ 25 ]. BIRC5 expression was significantly higher by approximately a 5-fold increase in tumors than in controls ( P =2.20E-10) (Figure  1A ). We also analyzed 185 ovarian carcinomas and 10 normal ovarian surface epithelia in the Oncomine database [ 26 ], and BIRC5 expression was significantly higher in tumors than in controls with approximately a 4-fold increase (Figure  1B ). In addition, we examined BIRC5 expression in ovarian cancer in the Oncomine database including 43 serous carcinomas and 10 peritoneal controls [ 27 ]; BIRC5 expression showed approximately a 20-fold increase in tumors compared to controls ( P =5.68E-8) (Figure  1C ). To confirm the findings of BIRC5 expression in ovarian cancer, we performed immunofluorescent staining on tumor sections of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (Figure  1D ) and found strong immunoreactivity for survivin in tumor cell nuclei but absent in the adjacent normal tissues (Figure  1E ). We also examined survivin expression by immunohistochemistry and results indicated that survivin expression was significantly higher in HGSOC than in fallopian tubes (Figure  1F ). In data set with information of clinical outcome (Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE13876) from 414 ovarian cancer patients), 207 patients were classified into the high expression group and the other 207 were classified into the low expression group by the median. Based on PROGgene program analysis [ 28 ], patients with high expression of survivin was significantly associated with poor survival and prognosis ( P  = 0.008, Figure  1G ). All these data suggest that BIRC5 is highly expressed in high grade serous ovarian cancer and the level of survivin overexpression is associated with poor prognosis.
Disruption of BIRC5 expression using lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 nickase mediated editing resulted in the inhibition of EMT in ovarian cancer cells
To disrupt BIRC5 expression in ovarian cancer cells, we examined endogenous BIRC5 expression in several ovarian cancer cell lines including SKOV3, OVCAR3, Hey and UACC1598 by western blot. Survivin was detected in all of them, and higher BIRC5 expression was found in SKOV3 and UACC1598 than Hey and OVCAR3 ( Supplementary Figure 1A ). SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cell lines were selected for our studies [ 29 ]. We constructed lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 nickase by using two gRNAs targeting a region of exon 1 (Figure  2A ) and then transduced both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. The lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 nickase vector-mediated mutations in SKOV3 cells were confirmed by using a DNA surveyor assay that the cleaved products were visible in cells transduced with BIRC5 gRNA vector but not in the control vector, indicating that BIRC5 mutation in exon 1 was successfully introduced by this approach (Figure  2B ). Next, using Western blot, we examined whether the disruption of the BIRC5 gene resulted in alteration of the survivin protein and EMT-associated markers in both ovarian cancer cells. Survivin was remarkably depleted in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells transduced with lentiviral BIRC5 gRNA vector (knockout) compared to control cells, and EMT markers were also altered by an upregulation of epithelial cell marker, cytokeratin-7 and downregulation of mesenchymal marker: vimentin, snai2 and β-catenin compared to control cells (Figure  2C ). To examine the EMT phenotype in ovarian cancer cells, we treated SKOV3 cells using 10 ng/ml of TGFβ for 48 h and cell morphology was imaged. These images clearly showed a fibroblast-like mesenchymal morphology in TGFβ induced control cells, but not in the survivin knockout cells, indicating that loss of survivin inhibited TGFβ induced EMT in SKOV3 cells ( Supplementary Figure 1B ). We further examined EMT marker gene expression by treating both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells with different doses of YM155, a small molecule inhibitor of survivin. Following dose-dependent inhibition of survivin, the epithelial cell marker, cytokeratin-7 was upregulated and mesenchymal markers: vimentin, snai2, and β-catenin were downregulated in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells (Figure  2D, 2E ). Disruption of BIRC5 with CRISPR/Cas9 nickase or inhibition of BIRC5 with a small inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of EMT in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. After BIRC5 was overexpressed using lentiviral overexpression vector in SKOV3 cells, survivin and EMT markers were examined by Western blot. We observed an upregulation of vimentin, snail2 and β-catenin and a downregulation of cytokeratin-7 following BIRC5 overexpression, indicating that survivin expression promoted EMT in ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells (Figure  2F ).
Disruption of BIRC5 expression led to the inhibition of cell proliferation and survival in ovarian cancer cells
To determine the functional outcome of losing BIRC5 expression in ovarian cancer cells, we examined cell proliferation in SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells with and without BIRC5 expression. Disruption of BIRC5 by CRISPR/Cas9 nickase significantly reduced cell proliferation compared to controls at all three time points (24, 48, and 72 h) in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells (Figure  3A, 3B ). We examined cell survival by assaying cell colony formation; loss of BIRC5 expression led to significant inhibition in both SKOV3 (Figure  3C ) and OVCAR3 cells (Figure  3D ). In addition, we tested the effect of two different doses of YM155 (0, 10 and 20 nM ) on cell proliferation by treating wild type cells for 24, 48, and 72 h, and cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in both SKOV3 (Figure  4A ) and OVCAR3 (Figure  4B ) cells. To examine how YM155 affected cell survival, we treated both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells using 5 nM of YM155 and found that it significantly inhibited cell survival based on the colony formation assay (Figure  4C, 4D ).
Disruption of BIRC5 expression led to the inhibition of cell migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cells
The loss of BIRC5 expression inhibited EMT in ovarian cancer cells and suggested that BIRC5 may affect cell motility and invasion. Using transwell plates, we examined cell migration in BIRC5 knockout and control cells and found that cell migration was significantly reduced in both the BIRC5 knockout, SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells (Figure  5A ). Using Matrigel-coated transwells, we assessed cell invasion, which was also significantly reduced in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells compared to the controls (Figure  5B ). To test whether survivin inhibitor has a similar effect on cell migration and invasion, we treated both cell lines with 20 nM YM155 for 4 h, and cell migration and invasion were determined with the same methods. Our results showed that inhibition of survivin with YM155 significantly reduced migration and invasion in both cell lines (Figure  6A, 6B ).
Disruption of BIRC5 expression sensitized cell responses to chemotherapy drug treatment
BIRC5 expression in ovarian cancer cells may contribute to chemoresistance. To test whether a loss of BIRC5 expression sensitized the cell response to chemotherapy, we treated BIRC5 knockout and control SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells with different doses of paclitaxel. Loss of BIRC5 expression induced cell apoptosis as shown by caspase3/7 activity and sensitized cell response to paclitaxel treatment at 20 and 40 nM doses in both SKOV3 (Figure  7A ) and OVCAR3 (Figure  7B ) cells. Using Western blot, we also detected cell apoptosis by examining cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase3. Both apoptotic proteins were significantly induced by losing BIRC5 expression with or without paclitaxel (Figure  7C ). To test whether an inhibition of BIRC5 expression with YM155 also induced cell apoptosis, both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells were treated with different doses from 50 to 200 nM; using Western blot, we detected apoptosis by examining cleaved PARP and caspase3 and found that inhibiting BIRC5 expression using YM155 induced cell apoptosis in both ovarian cancer cells (Figure  7D ). Our data indicate that disruption of BIRC5 expression enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy in ovarian cancer cells.
Loss of BIRC5 expression attenuated TGFβ signaling pathway in ovarian cancer cells
As we showed in our previous study, TGFβ promoted EMT in ovarian cancer cells [ 30 ]. To understand how BIRC5 regulates EMT in ovarian cancer cells, we tested the correlation between survivin and the TGFβ pathway in ovarian cancer cells. First, we determined BIRC5 expression in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells following TGFβ treatment at different time points (0, 6, 12, 24h ) and found that TGFβ induced survivin expression (Figure  8A ). Next, to determine whether BIRC5 expression was involved in the TGFβ pathway we treated BIRC5 knockout and control SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells at different time points (0, 10 and 20 min) and then examined phospho- and total SMAD2 by using Western blot. Loss of survivin resulted in attenuating the TGFβ signaling pathway in the BIRC5 knockout compared to control cells (Figure  8B ). We also determined the TGFβ pathway following 20 nM YM155 treatment and found that inhibition of survivin attenuated phospho-SMAD2 in both SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells (Figure  8C ). Our data indicated that loss of BIRC5 expression attenuated the TGFβ signaling pathway, thereby potentially leading to the inhibition of EMT in ovarian cancer cells.
