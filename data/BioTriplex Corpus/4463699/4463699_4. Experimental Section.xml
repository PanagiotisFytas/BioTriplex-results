4.1. Samples

           4.1.1. Processing of Blood Samples for DNA and RNA Isolation 
           n  = 56) in BD Vacutainer ®  CPT™ Cell Preparation Tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at the Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, PA, USA. The collection of the samples was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Geisinger Clinic, Danville, PA, USA.  Table 1  summarizes the groups used in the methylation and gene expression studies. All samples and information about the donors are listed in  Supplementary Table S1 . Patients were considered non-smokers if they never smoked or did not smoke in the last approximately 20 years. Patients who were current smokers were classified as smokers. Individuals who had given up smoking one day to 20 years ago were excluded from the study. All AAA patients were identified within our vascular surgery clinic and had a duplex ultrasound (DU) or computed tomography (CT) imaging demonstrating an aortic diameter >3 cm. All control patients were also identified within the same vascular surgery clinic. To qualify as a control, the subject must have had palpable pedal pulses (to exclude the inclusion of patients with peripheral arterial disease) and have had DU or CT imaging demonstrating an aortic diameter <3 cm. Patients who were <65 years of age or those without a smoking history also qualified for control status without radiographic confirmation of a normal aortic diameter provided the aortic pulse was normal upon physical examination by a vascular surgeon. These patients were deemed eligible for control status as AAA screening in this population is not currently covered by Medicare and is not recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force [ 39 ]. Blood samples were collected from patients ( 
           ®  Mini Kit (catalog #69504; Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA was isolated from PBMC using RNeasy ®  Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Quality of the RNA samples was assessed by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) are shown in  Supplementary Table S1 . PBMC were isolated from the blood samples within 1 h of the blood draw. The PBMC pellets were stored at −80 °C until used for the experiments. DNA was isolated from PBMC with DNeasy 
        

           4.1.2. Human Aortic Tissue Samples 
           n  = 6) at the Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, PA, USA. Non-aneurysmal aortic samples ( n  = 4) were collected at autopsies. The same autopsy samples have been used in previous studies [ 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ], and have demonstrated comparable results to aneurysmal tissue in mRNA and protein analyses. The collection of human tissues was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Geisinger Clinic, Danville, PA, USA and Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA. Samples were stored in phosphate-buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Details on the samples are listed in  Table 2 . Full thickness aortic wall tissue specimens were collected from patients undergoing AAA repair operations ( 
        
4.2. Microarray-Based DNA Methylation Study
Human Methylation 450k BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) were used to study methylation patterns in AAA and control samples using genomic DNA isolated from PBMC, as described above. The nature of the methylation sites assayed by the chips was extensively described recently [ 26 ]. Samples were run in two batches, and hybridizations were performed by HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology (Huntsville, AL, USA).  Table 1  summarizes the sample groups used and  Supplementary Table S1  contains information about each donor.
Methylation data were analyzed using the R language and multiple Bioconductor packages [ 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ]. Data were quantile adjusted. Methylation data from the chips are ratio beta values, which are calculated by the intensity of the methylated probe over the total intensity. Using the wateRmelon package, ratio β values were quantile adjusted. Then, ratio β values were converted to  M  values because ratio statistics are between 0 and 1, which does not work well in linear analyses. This conversion was done using the wateRmelon package [ 47 ]. The package transforms the values using this formula:  M  = log [β/(1 − β)]. PC analysis was performed for both batches combined to detect batch differences, and separately to detect global differences in methylation due to diagnosis, age, and smoking. By performing the PC analysis tests were performed on the reduced data without testing each CpGI as a separate hypothesis. We therefore did not correct the beadchip data for multiple testing. We also reduced false positives by using two separate data sets to identify CpGIs which were concordant between the two data sets.
Next, a subset of CpGIs was created. First, PCs significant for diagnosis, age, and smoking were chosen from each batch. Then the CpGIs that contributed most to the variance within those PCs were isolated. Finally, CpGIs that had the same direction and magnitude of change in each batch were selected, resulting in a subset of 16 CpGIs. This subset was analyzed using OLS linear regression models to determine relevance of diagnosis and covariates [ 49 ]. The IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno. ilmn12.hg19 package from Bioconductor was used to annotate genes [ 48 ].
4.3. Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR
Validated commercially available gene expression assays for  CNN2  and  SERPINB9  (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used to detect mRNA in AAA and control samples using RNA isolated from PBMC, as described above. Levels of 18S RNA and  RPL  mRNA were determined to standardize the results, and all experiments were run in triplicate.  Table 1  summarizes the samples used and  Supplementary Table S1  contains information about the donors. After PCR, baselines and threshold values were set for signals using Sequence Detection System software according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Applied Biosystems) and the threshold cycle numbers ( C t ) were computed for each well. Relative expression levels were calculated using the ∆ C t  method where the expression of  RPL  was an internal control. Statistical analysis was performed using OLS linear regression models as implemented in the program R [ 46 ]. The results are presented as a box-and-whiskers plot [ 51 ].
4.4. Immunohistochemical Analysis of Aortic Tissue
Immunostaining was carried out with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue as previously described [ 52 ]. The slides were incubated with a primary antibody ( Table 5 ) on an automatic immunostainer (Autostainer; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA). A secondary antibody with peroxidase labelled polymer (UltraVision LP Detection System, Thermo Fisher Scientific Lab Vision, Freemont, CA, USA) was used and the signal was detected with substrate chromogen solution. All antibodies were first tested on tissue known to contain the protein of interest as positive controls. Nonspecific IgG antibody in lieu of primary antibody served as a negative control.
For evaluation of the stained slides microscope Nikon Optiphot-2 (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with Nikon Digital Camera DS-Fi2 was used. The camera software was NIS-Elements V4.13 (Nikon).
4.5. Bioinformatic Analyses
Potential interactions between  CNN2  and  SERPINB9  were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ®  (IPA) tool version 9.0 (Qiagen’s Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA;  www.ingenuity.com ). Results were presented as a network.
