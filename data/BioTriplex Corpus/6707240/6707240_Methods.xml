Cell lines and cell culture
The human osteosarcoma cell lines 143B, HOS, MG63, SaOS-2, U2OS, and the murine cell line K7M2 were originally obtained from ATCC (LGC Standards Sarl; Molsheim, France). The human cell line IOR/OS18 was kindly provided by Prof M Serra (Istituti Ortopedici Rizzoli; Bologna; Italy). The human cell line CAL72 was kindly provided by Dr N Rochet (Institute of Biology Valrose, Nice, France) 23 . The human cell line OHS-4 was kindly provided by Drs Fournier and Price 24 . The human HOS-Doxo R  cell lines was established by continual exposure to increasing concentration of Doxorubicin (from 0.01 µM up to 1.3 µM) 9 .
All the cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated Fœtal Calf Serum, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The culture media were replaced three times a week.
Lentiviral transduction
Cells were seeded at a density of 25,000 cells/cm². The next day, cells were transduced with lentiviral particles encoding human sh-MT2A, murine sh-MT2 or non-targeting (control) shRNA sequences purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Virus-containing medium was changed with fresh medium 24 hrs after infection. Four days later, stably modified cells were selected with 10 µg/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 days. Viable cells were then routinely maintained in complete medium.
  cell viability assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cells/cm², and the next day treated with the indicated drug for 24 or 72 h. Cell viability was evaluated by the MTS tetrazolium assay (CellTiter 96 aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay kit; Promega, Charbonnieres, France), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The half-maximal inhibitory concentration IC50 was interpolated from sigmoidal dose-responses curves (IC50 Calculator software; AAT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Wound healing assay
The cell migration rate was assessed using the IncuCyte Live Cell Imaging system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Essen Bioscience Ltd., Birmingham, UK). Cells monolayers were scratched, then washed once and maintained in culture with phase-contrast photographs collected every 4 hrs for 72 hrs.
Glutathione assay
The level of total glutathione (GSSG + GSH) was assessed using glutathione assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
RNA extraction
The RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and stored at −80 °C in RNase-free water. Purity and quantity of RNA samples were assessed using the NanoVue Plus spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Velizy-Villacoublay, France).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA (1 µg) were denatured for 10 min at 70 °C then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min in a buffer containing MMLV reverse transcriptase (10U), DTT (dithiothreitol; 3 mM), oligodT primers (0.05 µM) and dNTPs (deoxynucleotide mix; 1 mM). A final step of inactivation of the enzyme is carried out at 95 °C for 5 min.
Quantitative PCR was performed on ViiA7 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using SYBR Green Master kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 0.5 µM of specific primers (Supplemental Table  1 ). Thermal conditions were: activation for 15 min at 95 °C then 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 sec, 59 °C annealing for 15 sec and 72 °C extension for 15 sec. Upon completion of each run, a melting curve analysis was performed to check specificity of the primers. All signals with threshold cycle (Ct) > 36 were set as undetermined. The relative gene expression was calculated using the 2 −∆∆Ct  method.
Xenograft models
All procedures were conducted according to the guidelines formulated by the European Commission for experimental animal use (L358-86/609EEC), and with the approval of the French local ethical animal committee (Comité d’éthique en Expérimentation Animale n°26/CEEA26, Villejuif, France). Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) female mice (Charles River, Arbresle, France) of 5-weeks old were randomized, housed at 22 °C to 24 °C with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and maintained in a pathogen-free enriched environment throughout the experiment. They were fed with a standard mice pellet diet and had free access to water. After acclimatization for 7 days, mice were injected intramuscularly (IM) with K7M2 cells (10 6  cells/15 µl PBS) in both thighs under isoflurane/air inhalational anaesthesia. After 10 days allowing tumour growth, mice were treated by intraperitoneal injection of cisplatinum (7 mg/kg body weight), doxorubicin (4 mg/kg body weight), etoposide (5 mg/kg body weight) or ifosfamide (100 mg/kg body weight) every 5 days. A vehicle-treated (saline) group was included. At day 28, mice were killed by CO 2  asphyxiation. Tumour diameters were measured with digital callipers, and the tumour volume in mm 3  was calculated by the formula = width × height × length × (π/6). Tumours and lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS before paraffin embedding.
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumours or lungs sections (4 µm thick) were deparaffinised in xylene and rehydrated through a graded series of ethanol before haematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining.
  cell death detection was performed on tumour sections by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling) assay according to the manufacturer’s recommendation (Roche Diagnostics, Boulogne-Billancourt, France). Slides were revealed with permanent Red (Dako-Agilent Technologies, Courtabœuf, France) and counterstained with haematoxylin.
Immuno-histological detection of MTs and Ki67 was performed on tumour sections. After immersion in 3% H 2 O 2  for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity, and an antigen retrieval heating step, with a citrate buffer (pH 6), at 98 °C for 30 min, slides were incubated for 10 min with blocking reagent (Klear Mouse HRP; GBI Labs, Bothell, WA, USA) to block nonspecific staining, and incubated for 60 min with mouse monoclonal anti-mouse metallothionein antibody (clone E9, Dako-Agilent Technologies) at a dilution of 1:200, or with anti-Ki67, 1:200 (Neomarkers, LabVision, Microm Microtech, Francheville, France). After two rinses in wash buffer, slides were incubated successively in an enhancer antibody and the polymer HRP anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, respectively for 30 min. Slides were washed and incubated for 5 min with DAB (diaminobenzidine) as peroxidase substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After rinsed by tap water, the slides were counterstained with haematoxylin.
Each slide was digitalized using an Olympus VS120 slide scanner. Quantitation of MT, and TUNEL positive cells was performed according to 25 , based on image analysis software (ImageJ 1.52 h, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).
Statistical procedures
The data were analysed by two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the statistical package super-ANOVA. The correlation coefficients were obtained by Spearman correlation analysis. Preclinical data was analysed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Paired samples were analysed with the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  P  value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
