MT2A mRNA level correlates with chemotherapy IC50 values
We first determined the expression level of MT2A in a panel of eight osteosarcoma cell lines by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Cell lines exhibited various basal expression level of MT2A mRNA (Fig.  1A ). We then determined the dose-response to five currently used chemotherapeutic drugs, namely cisplatinum, doxorubicin, etoposide, mafosfamide and methotrexate. Cells in exponential phase of growth were exposed to the indicated drugs for 72 hrs, and cell viability was assessed by the MTS test. All tested drugs dose-dependently reduced cell viability, but cell lines exhibited various sensitivity to a given drug, as reflected by half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values (Supplemental Table  2 ). IC50 values are consistent with those referenced in 8 . Figure 1 A ) Expression pattern of MT2A in a panel of osteosarcoma cell lines, as assessed by RT-qPCR. GAPDH was used as internal reference gene. The relative mRNA level was calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCT  method and expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n = 3–5). ( B – F ) Spearman correlation between the MT2A mRNA level and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values determined for cisplatinum ( B ), doxorubicin ( C ), etoposide ( D ), mafosfamide ( E ) and methotrexate ( F ). The black line shows the regression line. The determination coefficient R² and the significance of the F test (P-value) are also given. Correlation between MT2A mRNA level and IC50 values for chemotherapeutic drugs. (
We then determined the correlation between MT2A mRNA level and IC50 values for each chemotherapeutic drug (Fig.  1B–F ). MG63 cell line was removed from the correlation analysis because of its huge basal MT2A expression. A strong positive correlation was detected between MT2A level and resistance to all tested drugs (R > 0.7, p < 0.05).
Taken together, these results indicate that MT2A mRNA level correlate with cell resistance to chemotherapy-based therapies currently used in osteosarcoma.
Chemotherapy treatment induces MT2A mRNA expression
To evaluate the up-regulation of MT2A level by chemotherapy, cells were exposed to cisplatinum, doxorubicin, etoposide, mafosfamide, methotrexate or solvent for 24 hrs, and MT2A mRNA level was determined by RT-qPCR. All tested drugs induced an about 2-fold up-regulation of MT2A mRNA level in all tested cell lines (Fig.  2 ). Figure 2 A ) Expression pattern of MT2A in 143B, CAL72, HOS, IOR/OS18, MG63, OHS4, SaOS2, and U2OS cells incubated for 24 hrs in the presence of the chemotherapeutic drugs (100 µM cisplatinum; 1.84 µM doxorubicin; 10 µM etoposide; 5 mM ifosfamide or 5 mM methotrexate) or solvent, as assessed by RT-qPCR. GAPDH was used as internal reference gene. The relative mRNA level was calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCT  method and expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n = 4). An asterisk (*) indicates a statistically significant difference ( p  < 0.05  vs . control). ( B ) Box plot of distribution of MT2A mRNA level in all cell lines incubated for 24 hrs in the presence of indicated drugs. Chemotherapy induces MT2A neo-synthesis. (
Then, to evaluate the possible involvement of glutathione (GSH), which is another key contributor to xenobiotic detoxication, cells were exposed to chemotherapeutic drugs for 24 hrs, and GSH level was determined using a colorimetric assay. Only etoposide induced a decrease in intracellular GSH level in all cell lines (−26 to −70%, p < 0.01  vs . solvent; Supplemental Fig.  1 ), whereas all other tested drugs did not affect GSH content.
Taken together, these results indicate that osteosarcoma cells rather promote MT2A neo-synthesis than trigger the glutathione-dependent detoxication in response to cisplatinum, doxorubicin, mafosfamide, or methotrexate. Etoposide exposure led to both MT2A induction and GSH efflux.
MT2A level does not correlate with osteosarcoma cell migration ability
We determined the migration speed of our panel of osteosarcoma cell lines both in basal culture conditions (Supplemental Fig.  2A ), and combined them to MT2A mRNA level (Supplemental Fig.  2B ). No correlation was detectable (R < 0.2; p > 0.5).
These results indicate that MT2A level did not influence cell migration rate.
MT2A silencing does not impact osteosarcoma cell behaviour
We established new stable cell lines modified by lentiviral transduction of shRNA sequences (Supplemental Fig.  3A ), and investigated the impact of a repression of MT2A on cell behaviour. Cell morphology, spreading and cellular body size (Supplemental Fig. 3B–E), as well as cell proliferation rate as assessed by BrdU incorporation assay (Supplemental Fig.  3F ) were comparable among the modified and parental cell lines. As detected in parental U2OS cells, the intracellular GSH level was unaffected by chemotherapy, except by etoposide (Supplemental Fig.  3G ), in a similar manner in shControl and shMT2A U2OS cells.
These results indicate that silencing MT2A expression does not affect cell behaviour in basal culture conditions.
MT2A silencing reinforces the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy drugs
To investigate the impact of a repression of MT2A on cell response to chemotherapy, we established new stable cell lines modified by lentiviral transduction of shRNA sequences. We investigated four cell lines exhibiting the highest IC50 to chemotherapy among the tested panel of osteosarcoma cell lines, namely IOR/OS18, CAL72, U2OS and OHS4 (Supplemental Table  2 ). As expected, the cells modified with sh-MT2A sequences exhibited significantly lower MT2A mRNA level (−50 to −70%  vs . shControl; Supplemental Fig.  4 ). We then evaluated the impact of lowered MT2A level on the dose-response to cisplatinum, doxorubicin, etoposide or ifosfamide. Cells in exponential phase of growth were exposed for 72 hrs to the indicated drugs. The MT2A-silenced cells exhibited a higher sensitivity to a given drug, as reflected by lower half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values as compared to shControl cells (Table  1 ).

To evaluate if repression of MT2A can reverse chemo-resistance, we modified HOS cells that have acquired  in vitro  resistance to doxorubicin (Resistance Index = 88; see Methods section) 9 . This HOS-Doxo R  cell line exhibited a cross-resistance to etoposide (RI = 140) but not to cisplatin or ifosfamide 9 . As expected, Hos-Doxo R  cells modified with sh-MT2A sequences exhibited significantly lower MT2A mRNA level (−40%  vs . shControl; Supplemental Fig.  4C ). The MT2A-silenced cells exhibited a higher sensitivity to a given drug, as reflected by lower IC50 values as compared to shControl cells (Table  2 ). Table 2 Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for chemotherapy. HOS R HOS Doxo Parental cells Control cells shMT2A cells cisplatinum 3.17 µM 2.42 µM 0.49 µM doxorubicin 0.05 µM 4.39 µM 0.02 µM etoposide 0.64 µM 90.5 µM 0.39 µM ifosfamide 9.81 µM 10.5 µM 1.89 µM R  incubated for 72 hrs in the presence of increasing doses of each indicated drug. Cell viability was assessed in human HOS Doxo
Taken together, these results indicate that silencing MT2A expression reinforces the cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, and can reverse cell chemo-resistance.
MT2A silencing promotes anti-tumour effects of chemotherapy in Xenograft models
We performed similar experiments with the murine osteosarcoma cell line K7M2. Stable transduction of shRNA sequences targeting MT2 gene resulted in significant decrease in MT2 mRNA level, as compared to shControl or parental cells (−55%, p < 0.05; Fig.  3A ). No significant modification in cell morphology or cell proliferation rate was detectable among the modified and parental cell lines (Fig.  3B,C , respectively). As observed in human cell lines, (i) only etoposide reduced GSH content in both shControl and shMT2 modified K7M2 cells (Fig.  3D ), (ii) all tested chemotherapy drugs induced MT2 mRNA expression in parental K7M2 cells (Fig.  3E ), and (iii) MT2-silenced cells exhibited a higher sensitivity to a given drug, as reflected by lower IC50 values as compared to shControl cells (Fig.  3F ). Figure 3 A ) Expression levels of MT2 in parental and stably modified K7M2 cells, as assessed by RT-qPCR. GAPDH was used as internal reference gene. The relative mRNA level was calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCT  method and expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). An asterisk (*) indicates a statistically significant difference  vs . shControl group ( p  < 0.05). ( B ) Representative images of parental, and shControl- or shMT2-modified K7M2 cells (200X magnification). ( C ) Relative DNA synthesis, as assessed by a BrdU incorporation colorimetric assay.

( D ) Relative glutathione (GSH) level in shControl- or shMT2-modified K7M2 cells incubated in the presence of the indicated drugs, as assessed by a colorimetric assay.

Cell viability was assessed in murine K7M2 cell line incubated for 24 hrs in the presence of increasing doses of each indicated drug. Characterization of MT2-silenced murine cell line. (
Taken together, these results indicate that the murine K7M2 cell line behaves the same as human cell lines and represents a suitable model for further  in vivo  investigations.
We injected shControl and shMT2 K7M2 cells in SCID mice, and then when tumours emerged we administrated chemotherapy regimen (cisplatinum, doxorubicin, etoposide or ifosfamide) or saline solution (vehicle) as described in the Methods section. As expected, the average tumour volume in mice injected with shControl cells was reduced by chemotherapy: from −25% with etoposide (p = 0.00046  vs . saline; Fig.  4A ); −29% with ifosfamide (p < 0.0001); −42% with doxorubicin (p < 0.0001) to −45% with cisplatinum (p < 0.0001). No difference was detected in the average tumour volume between shMT2 and shControl groups without treatment (saline; p > 0.1). The tumour volume was more drastically reduced by chemotherapy regimens in the shMT2 group, as compared to treated mice bearing shControl cells-derived tumour: from −40% with etoposide (p = 0.0028  vs . shControl); −41% with ifosfamide (p = 0.0058); −58% with doxorubicin (p = 0.0033) to −87% with cisplatinum (p < 0.0001).

( E ) Spearman correlation between the number of TUNEL positive cells, and tumour volume. The black line shows the regression line. The determination coefficient R² and the significance of the F test (P-value) are also given. ( F ) Spearman correlation between the number of MTs positive cells, and tumour volume. The determination coefficient R² and the significance of the F test (P-value) are also given. Silencing of MT2 improves chemotherapy cytotoxic effects in a preclinical model. K7M2 cells modified with shControl or shMT2 were injected intramuscularly into the thighs of SCID mice and administered with chemotherapy as described in the Methods section. (
MT expression was assessed by IHC staining of FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) tumour sections (Fig.  5 ). As expected, the MT protein level in mice injected with shControl cells was induced by chemotherapy: from 2.7-fold with cisplatinum (p = 0.0384  vs . saline; Fig.  4B ); 2.9-fold with doxorubicin (p = 0.0005); 3-fold with ifosfamide (p = 0.0001); to 3.4-fold with etoposide (p < 0.0001). As expected, the average signal was reduced in untreated (saline) shMT2 group as compared to shControl group (−32%, p = 0.0074), and markedly reduced in all treated conditions: from −57% with cisplatinum (p = 0.0248); −72% with doxorubicin (p = 0.0127); −85% with etoposide (p < 0.0001) to −86% with ifosfamide (p < 0.0001). Figure 5 Silencing of MT2 improves chemotherapy cytotoxic effects in a preclinical model.

A negative control of the MTs stain by omitting the primary antibody, and a positive control of MTs stain on normal liver sample were included. The scale bars represent 50 μm (right panel). Representative images illustrating TUNEL staining in primary tumour FFPE sections. A negative control of TUNEL stain by omitting the primary antibody was included.
Cell death was assessed by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling) staining of FFPE tumour sections (Fig.  5 ). As expected, the percentage of TUNEL positive cells in shControl cells-derived tumour was increased by chemotherapy: from +41% with ifosfamide (p = 0.0012  vs . saline; Fig.  4C ); +45% with doxorubicin (p = 0.00018); +68% with etoposide (p = 0.0003) to +76% with cisplatinum (p = 0.0034). No difference was detected in the percentage of TUNEL positive cells between shMT2 and shControl groups without treatment (saline; p > 0.1). The average TUNEL positive cells percentage was more drastically increased by chemotherapy regimens in the shMT2 group, as compared to treated mice bearing shControl cells-derived tumours: from +77% with ifosfamide (p = 0.0188  vs . shControl); 2-fold with etoposide (p = 0.0028); 2.2-fold with doxorubicin (p = 0.042) to 2.5-fold with cisplatinum (p = 0.0043).
Overall, the TUNEL positive cell number negatively correlated with MT positive cell number and tumour volume (R² > 0.5; p < 0.05; Fig.  4D,E ). In contrast, no correlation was detected between MT2 level and tumour volume (R² < 0.1, p > 0.7; Fig.  4F ).
Pulmonary metastatic foci were assessed by HES staining of FFPE lung sections (Fig.  6A ). As expected, the average metastatic surface was markedly reduced by chemotherapy regimens in the mice injected with shControl cells: from −60% with ifosfamide (p = 0.037  vs . saline; Fig.  6B ); −61% with doxorubicin (p = 0.036); −76% with etoposide (p = 0.0042) to −87% with cisplatinum (p = 0.0031). No difference could be detected in the average metastatic surface at sacrifice between shMT2 and shControl groups without treatment (saline; p > 0.3). The average metastatic surface was not more drastically reduced in the mice injected with shMT2 cells, as compared to mice injected with shControl cells when treated with chemotherapy (p > 0.2).

The black line shows the regression line. The determination coefficient R² and the significance of the F test (P-value) are also given. ( E ) Spearman correlations between the number of metastatic nodules per field, and tumour volume. Silencing of MT2 influences chemotherapy tumour pulmonary metastatic dissemination. K7M2 cells modified with shControl or shMT2 were injected intramuscularly into the thighs of SCID mice and administered with chemotherapy as described in the Methods section. (
The average number of metastases was markedly reduced by chemotherapy regimens in the mice injected with shControl cells (−38% to −79%, p < 0.01; Fig.  6C ), and more drastically reduced in the mice injected with shMT2 cells by cisplatinum (−96%, p = 0.00045  vs . saline) or doxorubicin (−77%, p = 0.0013), whereas no difference could be detected between shMT2 and shControl groups without treatment (saline; p = 0.335).
Overall, the metastatic surface and the number of metastases positively correlated with tumour volume (Fig.  6D,E , respectively).
Taken together, these results confirm that MT2A level influence chemotherapy induced-cell death, and primary tumour development resulting in modulation of pulmonary metastatic dissemination.
