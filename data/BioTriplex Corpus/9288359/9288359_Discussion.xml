To our knowledge, this is the first real-world report regarding the combination use of lenvatinib and nivolumab in advanced HCC which showed promising results with an ORR of 45.0% by mRECIST, PFS of 7.5 months, and OS of 14.6 months. These data suggested that lenvatinib plus nivolumab a potential combination in advanced HCC.
Cumulative evidence disclosed that the activation of FGF pathway signaling had an essential role in developing and worsening HCC [ 18 ]. Matsuki et al. performed in vitro studies in human HCC cell lines and in vivo studies in mice xenograft models showing that FGF19 –FGFR4 axis enhanced HCC proliferation and growth [ 19 ]. These findings may explain the high response rate of lenvatinib, a FGFR 1–4 inhibitor, in advanced HCC [ 4 ].
Lenvatinib, like other multiple kinase inhibitors, has been found to have immunomodulatory effects [ 14 ]. VEGFA and bFGF significantly upregulated the expression of immune-checkpoint markers and inhibited secretion of IFN-γ and granzyme B, which suppressed T cell cytotoxicity. This immunosuppressive effect was reverted by lenvatinib [ 20 ]. Another study showed the activation of FGFR signaling downregulated JAK/STAT pathway leading to the decrease of IFN-γ secretion. With the use of lenvatinib inhibited FGFR signaling restoring the IFN-γ stimulation [ 21 ]. In addition, several studies demonstrated that lenvatinib increased the percentage of activated CD8 + T cells that secreting IFN-γ and granzyme B [ 15 ,  21 ,  22 ]. However, the antitumor activity of lenvatinib was attenuated in immunodeficient mice by CD8 + T cell depletion [ 15 ]. On the other hand, lenvatinib decreased the proportion of monocytes and macrophages population, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [ 15 ,  21 ,  22 ]. Taking together, lenvatinib promoted anti-tumor immunity by increased IFN-γ–producing CD8 T-cell and decreased TAMs, which makes lenvatinib potential to combine with immunotherapy.
Lenvatinib combined with anti-PD-1 induced greater antitumor activity and had longer survival in animal model of renal cell carcinoma [ 21 ]. Two HCC syngeneic mouse model showed that the combination therapy increased more percentage of IFN-γ + and granzyme B + CD8 + T cells and decreased the macrophages population [ 15 ,  22 ]. Combined therapy also reducedPD-1 + T cells and modulated inflammatory factors which had an extensive immunomodulatory effect in the tumor microenvironment in HCC mouse model. Additionally, the immunomodulatory effect was more potent when combined with lenvatinib than sorafenib [ 20 ].Therefore, the combination of lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 synergistically modulated the TME and enhanced antitumor immunity.
Lenvatinib combined anti-PD-1 has been approved in endometrial carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. In KEYNOTE-775/Study 309, lenvatinib and pembrolizumab demonstrated an ORR of 30%, PFS 6.6 months (HR 0.60) and OS 17.4 months (HR 0.68), which was superior to doxorubicin or paclitaxel in platinum-experienced endometrial carcinoma [ 23 ]. In renal cell carcinoma, the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab was highly effective with an ORR of 38% in the phase Ib/II trial KEYNOTE-146 [ 24 ]. In the phase III CLEAR trial, lenvatinib combined with pembrolizumab showed a longer PFS (23.9 vs. 9.2 months; HR 0.39) and OS (HR 0.66) than sunitinib [ 25 ]. In HCC, a phase Ib study of lenvatinib plus nivolumab showed the ORR of 54% and PFS of 7.4 months [ 16 ]. Another phase I-II study of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab had the ORR of 36% and PFS of 8.6 months [ 26 ]. These clinical trials revealed promising results that is comparable with the synergistic effect in animal model.
For the treatment outcomes of other combined regimens in advanced HCC, a global open-labeled phase III trial (IMbrave150) revealed atezolizumab plus bevacizumab had a higher ORR (27.3% vs. 11.9%), longer PFS (6.8 vs. 4.3 months) and OS (non-reached vs. 13.2 months) then sorafenib [ 8 ]. In the phase II study of CheckMate-040, the combination nivolumab and ipilimumab yielded an ORR of 27–32% andOS (12.5–22.8 months) among different dose of combination in HCC patients who progressed from sorafenib [ 27 ]. In our study, lenvatinib combined nivolumab showed an objective response rate of 45% and a median PFS of 7.3 months. Therefore, our study demonstrated comparable efficacy to the treatments mentioned above.
The most adverse effects were graded 1–2 in this study. Skin reactions such as dermatitis and pruritis, and hypothyroidism were most common and could be caused by lenvatinib or nivolumab. Severe AEs including two gastric intestinal bleeding and one duodenal perforation were more likely related to lenvatinib; one patient suffered grade 5 pneumonitis was likely related to nivolumab. Overall, the toxicity profile was comparable to those reported in the phase Ib study of lenvatinib combined nivolumab and phase I-II study of lenvatinib combined pembrolizumab [ 16 ,  28 ].
There were several limitations in our study. First, this is a retrospective study, the information bias and selection bias may exist. However, imbalanced factors of age and HBV infection were not independent risk factors. Therefore, this study still provided a proof of concept. Second, whether the results apply to non-Asian populations is unclear because of the different etiologies between Asian and Western countries. Nevertheless, the response and prognosis were not significantly different regardless of virus infection.
