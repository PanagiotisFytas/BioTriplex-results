Patient characteristics
Between January 2016 to December 2020, 40 HCC patients received lenvatinib in combination with nivolumab in our center were included. Among them, twenty-nine patients were male. The mean age was 58.5 ± 13.8; 77.5% (29/40) had HBV, 10.0% (4/40) had HCV, and 37.5% (15/40) had alcoholism history. Child–Pugh score A accounted for 62.5% of patients and Child–Pugh score B for 37.5%. Fifty percent of patients were diagnosed to have portal vein thrombosis and 25% already had distant metastasis. Regard to previous sorafenib treatment, 50% of patients has been experienced and 50% were sorafenib naïve. Additionally, 47 HCC patients with lenvatinib monotherapy were enrolled. Lenvatinib group had similar liver function and tumor stage as combination group, but older age and less HBV infection. Notably, all the patients in lenvatinib group were first-line treatment. The subsequent treatment was given in 84.4% (27/32) and 77.8% (21/27) in L + P and L group, respectively ( p  = 0.52). The detailed demographic and clinical characteristics were shown in Table  1 .

Treatment response
In the L + N group, the ORR was 45.0% and DCR 82.5% by mRECIST, and 20.0%, 82.5% by RECIST 1.1 (Fig.  1 ). Notably, three patient (7.5%) were defined as CR with mRECIST (one of the cases was shown in supplemental Fig.  2 ). Compared with the L group, the L + N group had a higher objective response rate (45.0% vs. 23.4%,  p  = 0.03). In the L + N group, patients with sorafenib naïve, HBV and HCV infection achieved numerically higher response rate without statistically significant (Table  2 ). Fig. 1 Maximum Change from Baseline in the Sum of Longest Diameters Lenvatinib plus nivolumab demonstrated remarkable tumor shrinkage and disease control by RECIST (left) and mRECIST criteria (right). PD was defined as 20% increase in tumor size, while partial response had a 30% decrease.

Progression-free survival and overall survival
The L + N group achieved longer PFS (7.5 vs. 4.8 months,  p  = 0.05) and OS (22.9 vs. 10.3 months,  p  = 0.01) than L group (Fig.  2 ). Notably, the survival curve of L + N group presented with a long tail. The median follow-up time of all patients was 12.3 months (6.2–21.0).
In L + P group, there was no significant difference regardless of sorafenib experienced and HCV infection (Fig.  3 A, D). Patients with HBV infection (non-reached vs. 12.4 months,  p  = 0.16) and REFLECT criteria fit (non-reached vs. 14.6 months,  p  = 0.16) demonstrated a trend of better prognosis (Fig.  3 B, C). For those patients who got response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria achieved longer tumor control and survival. The median OS were significantly different among patients with PR, SD, and PD (non-reached vs. 14.6 vs. 4.7 months,  p  = 0.03). The median PFS were 11.2 months, 6.4 months, and 2.2 months for patients with PR, SD, and PD respectively( p  < 0.0001) (supplemental Fig.  1 A, B).

Prognostic factors
Among all the 87 HCC patients, HCV, PVT, and AFP > 400 ng/mL were poor prognostic factors and nivolumab used was protective factor in the univariate analysis. In multi-variates analysis, only PVT (HR 4.3, 95% C.I. 1.5–12.8) and AFP > 400 ng/mL (HR 3.3, 95% C.I. 1.1–9.3) were poor prognostic factors and nivolumab used remained a protective factor (HR 0.2, 95% C.I. 0.1–0.7) (Table  3 ).

Toxicity
In all grades of toxicities, dermatitis (35.0%), pruritis (27.5%), and hypothyroidism (27.5%) were most common. Few patients developed grade 3/4 toxicities including dermatitis (15.0%), GI bleeding (7.5%), hypertension (5.0%), pneumonitis (2.5%) and stomatitis (2.5%). Notably, only 5.0% of patients developed grade 1/2 hand-foot skin reaction. Severe adverse events were noted in 10% of patients, that included 2 gastric intestinal bleeding, 1 duodenal perforation and 1 pneumonitis (Table  4 ).
