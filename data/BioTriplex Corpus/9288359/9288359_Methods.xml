Patients and study design
Between January 2016 and December 2020, patients with advanced HCC who underwent lenvatinib combined nivolumab (L + N group) at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who have Child–Pugh Score C, aged less than 20-year-old, or those without effective assessment were excluded. A total of 40 patients were enrolled after screening. To compare the efficacy between combination therapy and lenvatinib monotherapy, additional 47 HCC patients underwent lenvatinib (L group) as 1 st  line therapy with the same inclusion criteria were enrolled. Lenvatinib was given 8 or 12 mg based on body weight and nivolumab was given 1–3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Patient characteristics, such as age, gender, etiologies, liver function, tumor stage, tumor marker, and previous local therapy and systemic therapy history were collected and analyzed. Child–Pugh score and ALBI grade were used to describe liver function, and Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging system to cancer staging. The diagnosis of HCC was defined as histological confirmation or clinical interpretation based on the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria [ 17 ].
Outcome assessment
Treatment response was assessed by computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging every 2–3 months. The treatment response including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) were reviewed by two independent specialists according to RECIST and mRECIST criteria (19). Treatment adverse events were graded according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the period from the beginning of treatment to death; progression-free survival (PFS) from the beginning of the treatment to disease progression or death.
Statistical analysis
For comparison of continuous variables, the student's t-test was used. For categorical variables between groups, the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was performed. We used logistic regression analysis to find the risk factors for death. In the univariate analysis, variables with  p  < 0.1 underwent multi-variates analysis using forward stepwise model. A  p  < 0.05 was considered as an independent prognostic factor. The Kaplan–Meier curves were compared by the Log-rank test. A  p  value < 0.05 was defined as a statistically significant difference. All the statistical analyses were performed by IBM® SPSS®, version 21.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).
