2.1. Isolation and Culture of HPDLCs
Healthy periodontal tissue was collected from five healthy candidates (16–26 years old; mean 17.8 years) who underwent tooth extraction as an orthodontic treatment. The teeth were placed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Hyclone, USA) immediately after extraction. The periodontal ligament tissues were scraped from the middle third of the tooth roots and then digested for 30 min at 37°C in 3 mg/ml collagenase type I (Sigma, USA). The resulting cell suspension was seeded in 25 cm 2  flasks containing alpha-minimal essential medium (Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2  incubator. Cells between the third and sixth generations were used for the subsequent experiments. This research protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Tongji University College.
2.2. Cell Counting Kit-8 Assay (CCK-8)
The CCK-8 assay (Beyotime, China) was used to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of CoCl 2  on cell proliferation. HPDLCs were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2000 cells/well in 100  μ l alpha-minimal essential medium, and then, different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, and 400  μ M) of CoCl 2  were added to stimulate cells for different periods (24 and 48 h). After 2 h of culture with 10  μ l/well CCK-8, the fluorescence intensity was measured at 450 nm. Cell proliferation was plotted relative to the untreated controls.
2.3. CoCl 2  Treatment to Mimic Hypoxic Treatment
CoCl 2  was dissolved directly in the cell culture medium and filtered by a 0.2  μ m filter to produce a concentrated solution of the culture medium. To mimic the hypoxic environment in vivo, the cells were treated with or without CoCl 2  at varying concentrations (200 and 400  μ M) for varying times (24 and 48 h). As part of the experiments, some cells were pretreated with the ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 10 mM) for 2 h before CoCl 2  (200  μ M) exposure for 24 h.
2.4. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA from rat periodontal tissues and HPDLCs was isolated using a TRIzol® reagent (Takara Ltd., Otsu, Japan), and cDNA was synthesized using PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara Ltd.). RT-PCR was conducted using qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Yeasen, China) and a LightCycler® 96 instrument (Roche, Germany). Primer sequences used for RT-PCR (Sangon, China) are listed in  Table 1 .
2.5. Western Blotting
Periodontal tissues were washed with PBS and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Beyotime, China). The tissue lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4°C: TXNIP (Rabbit IgG, Boster, China), NLRP3 (Rabbit IgG, Boster, China), ASC (Rabbit IgG, Immunoway, China), and caspase-1 (Rabbit IgG, Immunoway, China) at 1 : 1000. Thereafter, they were incubated with antirabbit IgG secondary antibody (CST, USA) at 1 : 5000 at room temperature for 2 h. The internal control was  β -actin (Rabbit IgG, Beyotime, China) at 1 : 1000. An Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LI-COR, USA) was used to detect antibody-bound proteins. Relative protein expression was normalized to  β -actin and quantified using the ImageJ software.
2.6. ROS and Immunofluorescence (IF) Assays
The cells were stimulated with CoCl 2  for 24 h in a 6-well plate. The level of ROS was detected with a ROS assay kit (Beyotime, China). Images were observed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan). The intensity of fluorescence before and after stimulation was measured in real time at 488 nm. For IF, HPDLCs were seeded into cell-climbing slices in a 12-well plate, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for permeabilization. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, the cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies (1 : 250) diluted in PBS: TXNIP (Rabbit IgG, Boster, China), NLRP3 (Rabbit IgG, Boster, China), ASC (Rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz, USA), and caspase-1 (Rabbit IgG, Immunoway, China). Finally, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor-488 and Alexa Fluor-555 conjugate secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, USA) for 1 h and the nuclei stained with DAPI for 5 min. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan) and a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon, Japan), and the fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ software.
2.7. Confocal Microscopy of Inflammasome Proteins in HPDLCs
Cells were handled as in the IF assay and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies (1 : 250) diluted in PBS: NLRP3 (Rabbit IgG, Boster, China), ASC (Mouse IgG, Santa Cruz, USA), and caspase-1 (Rabbit IgG, Immunoway, China). Next, the cells were cleaned and labeled with Alexa Fluor-488 and Alexa Fluor-555 conjugate secondary antibodies and then sequentially scanned and visualized using an Olympus laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, USA) was used for colocalization analysis, and the Pearson correlation coefficient represented colocalization.
2.8. Animals and Unilateral Nasal Obstruction (UNO) Model
A UNO rat model was established by cauterizing the external nostril [ 24 – 26 ]. Briefly, 8-day-old male Wistar rats ( n  = 30) were randomly divided into two groups: SHAM and UNO. Rats in the two groups were first anesthetized by hypothermia (10 min at -20°C), and then, the external nostril of rats in the UNO group was burned using a heated hot container for the gutta-percha point, whereas in the SHAM group, the surrounding tissues of the left nostril were burned. Rats in both groups were raised in the animal facility of Tongji University, Shanghai, China, under specific pathogen-free (Suzhou Fengshi Laboratory Animal Equipment, China) conditions at 22 ± 2°C under a 12 : 12 h light : dark cycle, with food and water provided ad libitum. In the experimental period, body weights were recorded, and nasal obstruction was confirmed every week. Rats whose external nostrils remained blocked throughout the experiment were considered successful models. After 7 weeks, all rats were humanely sacrificed. The periodontal tissue was collected and processed for analysis as describe below. This research protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Tongji University College.
2.9. Histological Assessment
Rat periodontal tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, prepared for paraffin-embedding (Beyotime, China), and sectioned into 4  μ m sections. For IF, the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies (1 : 250) diluted in PBS: TXNIP (Rabbit IgG, Boster, China), NLRP3 (Rabbit IgG, Boster, China), ASC (Rabbit IgG, Immunoway, USA), and caspase-1 (Rabbit IgG, Immunoway, China) and then incubated with Alexa Fluor-488 and Alexa Fluor-555 conjugate secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. For the TUNEL assay, a One-Step TUNEL Assay Kit (Boster, China) was used. All sections were then stained with DAPI (Beyotime, China) for 5 min in the dark. Sections were captured using a fluorescence microscope and a confocal laser scanning microscope, and the fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ software.
2.10. Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., USA). The data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA, and then, the Bonferroni post hoc test was used to test the selected comparison or Dunnett's multiple comparison post hoc test, if each group needed to be compared with the control group. Statistically significant difference was determined at  ∗ p  < 0.05.
