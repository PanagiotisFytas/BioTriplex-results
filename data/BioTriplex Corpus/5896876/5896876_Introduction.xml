In the adult rodent brain, coordinated patterns of oscillatory activity code in a frequency-specific manner for sensory and cognitive performance. For example, learning and memory critically depend on oscillations within theta frequency band (4–12 Hz) that functionally couple the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HP) ( Siapas and Wilson, 1998 ;  Benchenane et al., 2010 ;  Brincat and Miller, 2015 ;  Backus et al., 2016 ;  Eichenbaum, 2017 ;  Wirt and Hyman, 2017 ). These frequency-tuned brain states are present already during early development, long before the memory and attentional abilities have fully matured. They have been extensively characterized and categorized according to their spatial and temporal structure ( Lindemann et al., 2016 ). Network oscillations during development have a highly discontinuous and fragmented structure with bursts of activity alternating with ‘silent’ periods ( Hanganu et al., 2006 ;  Seelke and Blumberg, 2010 ;  Shen and Colonnese, 2016 ;  Luhmann and Khazipov, 2018 ). The most common oscillatory pattern, spindle bursts, synchronizes large cortical and subcortical networks within theta-alpha frequency range. It is accompanied by slow delta waves as well as by faster discharges (beta and gamma oscillations) that account for local activation of circuits ( Brockmann et al., 2011 ;  Yang et al., 2016 ).
In the absence of direct behavioral correlates, a mechanistic understanding of oscillatory rhythms in the developing brain is currently lacking. In sensory systems, spindle bursts have been proposed to act as a template facilitating the formation of cortical maps ( Dupont et al., 2006 ;  Hanganu et al., 2006 ;  Tolner et al., 2012 ), whereas early gamma oscillations seem to control the organization of thalamocortical topography ( Minlebaev et al., 2011 ;  Khazipov et al., 2013 ). In limbic systems dedicated to mnemonic and executive abilities, the knowledge on the relevance of early network oscillations is even sparser. Few lesion studies, yet without selectivity for specific activity patterns, suggested that prefrontal-hippocampal communication during development might be necessary for the maturation of episodic memory ( Krüger et al., 2012 ). Temporal associations between the firing and synaptic discharges of individual neurons and network oscillations in different frequency bands gave first insights into the cellular substrate of coordinated activity in neonates. Whereas in sensory systems, endogenous activation of sensory periphery drives entrainment of local circuitry through gap junction coupling as well as glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission ( Dupont et al., 2006 ;  Hanganu et al., 2006 ;  Minlebaev et al., 2009 ), in developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks, the excitatory drive from the HP has been proposed to activate a complex layer- and frequency-specific interplay in the PFC ( Brockmann et al., 2011 ;  Bitzenhofer and Hanganu-Opatz, 2014 ;  Bitzenhofer et al., 2015 ).
While most of this correlative evidence put forward the relevance of early oscillations beyond a simple epiphenomenal signature of developing networks, direct evidence for their causal contribution to circuit maturation is still missing. This is mainly due to the absence of a causal interrogation of developing networks, similarly to the investigations done in adult ones. Only recently the methodological difficulties related to area-, layer- and cell type-specific manipulations at neonatal age have been overcome ( Bitzenhofer et al., 2017a ;  Bitzenhofer et al., 2017b ). By these means, the local neuronal interplay generating beta-gamma oscillations in the PFC has been elucidated. However, the long-range coupling causing the activation of local prefrontal circuits is still unresolved. We previously proposed that the hippocampal CA1 area drives the oscillatory entrainment of PFC at neonatal age ( Brockmann et al., 2011 ). Here, we developed a methodological approach to optically manipulate the neonatal HP along its septo-temporal axis. We provide causal evidence that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of intermediate and ventral (i/vHP), but not of dorsal HP (dHP) elicits broad band oscillations in the PFC of neonatal mice via dense axonal projections.
