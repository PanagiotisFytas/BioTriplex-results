Title: Glutamatergic drive along the septo-temporal axis of hippocampus boosts prelimbic oscillations in the neonatal mouse.
Abstract: The long-range coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks that account for cognitive performance emerges early in life. The discontinuous hippocampal theta bursts have been proposed to drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations, yet the cellular substrate of these early interactions is still unresolved. Here, we selectively target optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefrontal oscillatory entrainment. We show that despite stronger theta and ripples power in dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected by  in utero  electroporation with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosts prefrontal oscillations. Our data causally elucidate the cellular origin of the long-range coupling in the developing brain.
When memories are stored, or mental tasks performed, different parts of the brain need to communicate with each other to process and extract information from the environment. For example, the communication between two brain areas called the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex is essential for memory and attention. However, it is still unclear how these interactions are established when the brain develops.
Now, by looking at how the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex ‘work’ together in newborn mouse pups, Ahlbeck et al. hope to understand how these brain areas start to connect. In particular, the groups of neurons that kick start the development of the circuits required for information processing need to be identified.
Recording the brains of the pups revealed that electrical activity in a particular sub-division of the hippocampus activated neurons in the prefrontal cortex. In fact, a specific population of neurons in this area was needed for the circuits in the prefrontal cortex to mature.
In further experiments, the neurons from this population in the hippocampus were manipulated so they could be artificially activated in the brain using light. When stimulated, these neurons generated electrical activity, which was then relayed through the neurons all the way to the prefrontal cortex. There, this signal triggered local neuronal circuits. Thanks to this activation, these circuits could ‘wire’ together, and start establishing the connections necessary for mental tasks or memory in adulthood.
The brain of the mouse pups used by Ahlbeck et al. was approximately in the same developmental state as the brain of human fetuses in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. These findings may therefore inform on how the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex start connecting in humans. Problems in the way brain areas interact during early development could be partly responsible for certain neurodevelopmental disorders and mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia. Understanding these processes at the cellular level may therefore be the first step towards finding potential targets for treatment.
