Distinct patterns of functional maturation in dorsal and intermediate/ventral hippocampus
The abundant literature dedicated to the adult hippocampus mainly deals with a single cortical module ( Amaral et al., 2007 ). However, an increasing number of studies in recent years revealed distinct organization, processing mechanisms and behavioral relevance for dHP vs. i/vHP ( Fanselow and Dong, 2010 ;  Bannerman et al., 2014 ;  Strange et al., 2014 ). For example, the dHP, which receives dense projections from the entorhinal cortex ( Witter and Amaral, 2004 ), is mainly involved in spatial navigation ( O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978 ;  Moser et al., 1995 ;  Moser et al., 1998 ). In contrast, the ventral part receives strong cholinergic and dopaminergic innervation ( Witter et al., 1989 ;  Pitkänen et al., 2000 ) and contributes to processing of non-spatial information ( Bannerman et al., 2003 ;  Bast et al., 2009 ). Correspondingly, the network and neuronal activity changes along the septo-temporal axis. The power of the most prominent activity pattern in the adult HP, the theta oscillations, as well as the theta timing of the neuronal firing was found to be substantially reduced in the i/vHP when compared with dHP ( Royer et al., 2010 ). By these means, the precise spatial representation deteriorates along the septo-temporal axis, since theta activity is directly linked to place cell representation ( O'Keefe and Recce, 1993 ;  Geisler et al., 2007 ). In contrast, SPWs are more frequent and ripples have higher amplitude and frequency in the ventral HP than in the dHP ( Patel et al., 2013 ).
Our data uncovered that some of these differences in the activity patterns along the septo-temporal axis emerge already during early neonatal development. Similar to findings from adult rodents, the power of theta bursts at neonatal age was higher in dHP than in i/vHP. The amplitude of SPWs and the power of ripples decreased along the septo-temporal axis. These findings give insights into the mechanisms underlying the early generation of activity patterns. It has been proposed that the differences in theta dynamics along the septo-temporal axis result from distinct innervation, on the one hand, and from specific intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons, on the other hand. Cholinergic projections of different origin in the dHP and i/vHP ( Stewart and Fox, 1990 ;  Amaral et al., 2007 ) as well as maturational differences in the intrinsic resonant properties of hippocampal neurons and notable gradients of parvalbumin immunoreactivity along the septo-temporal axis ( Honeycutt et al., 2016 ) may contribute to the observed differences.
Quantification along the septo-temporal axis revealed that, similar to adults, the occurrence of SPWs was higher in the i/vHP and their amplitude was larger in the neonatal dHP ( Patel et al., 2013 ). It is still an issue of debate when exactly ripples emerge in the developing hippocampus, although it is obvious that they appear later than theta bursts and SPWs, most likely towards the end of the first and during second postnatal week ( Buhl and Buzsáki, 2005 ;  Brockmann et al., 2011 ). Their underlying mechanisms at neonatal age remain also largely unknown and need to be related to age-dependent changes in gap junctional coupling and GABA switch ( Ben-Ari et al., 1989 ;  Zhang et al., 1990 ;  Yuste et al., 1995 ). The organization of SPWs and ripples is of particular relevance when considering their impact on the early activity of PFC. Already at neonatal age, the prelimbic firing and oscillatory entrainment is timed by SPWs-ripples. Of note, the degree of timing varies along the septo-temporal axis and is much higher for the i/vHP.
Optogenetic interrogation of long-range coupling in the developing brain
At adult age the communication between PFC and HP has been investigated in relationship with memory tasks both under physiological and disease-related conditions ( Sirota et al., 2008 ;  Adhikari et al., 2010 ;  Sigurdsson et al., 2010 ;  Eichenbaum, 2017 ). Depending on the phase of memory processing, the prefrontal-hippocampal coupling via oscillatory synchrony has been found to be either unidirectional from the HP to PFC or bidirectional ( Siapas et al., 2005 ;  Hallock et al., 2016 ;  Place et al., 2016 ). Both theta and gamma network oscillations contribute to the functional long-range coupling. The model of prefrontal-hippocampal communication has been initially built based on experimental evidence correlating the temporal organization of neuronal and network activity in the two brain areas. The time delay between spike trains and oscillatory phase or between oscillations enabled to propose that the information flows in one direction or the other via mono- or polysynaptic axonal projections. More recently, a direct causal assessment of the coupling became possible through optogenetic interrogation of neural circuits. In a seminal study, Spellman and colleagues used light-driven inhibition of axonal terminals for dissecting the directionality of interactions between PFC and HP during different phases of memory retrieval ( Spellman et al., 2015 ).
We previously showed that at neonatal age, long before full maturation of memory and attentional abilities, discontinuous theta bursts in i/vHP are temporally correlated to the network oscillations in the PFC and time the prefrontal firing ( Brockmann et al., 2011 ;  Hartung et al., 2016 ). Moreover, the temporal delay of 10–20 ms between prefrontal and hippocampal spike trains as well as the estimated directionality of information flow between the two areas suggested that hippocampal theta drives the oscillatory entrainment of the local circuits in the PFC. The present data directly prove this hypothesis, taking advantage of the recently developed protocol for optogenetic manipulation of neuronal networks at neonatal age ( Bitzenhofer et al., 2017a ,  2017b ). We observed that prelimbic circuits were effectively entrained when the stimulation of paramidal neurons in i/vHP occurred at 8 Hz but not at 4 Hz or 16 Hz. Such frequency-specific effect might result from intrinsic resonance properties of neurons mediated through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels ( Hu et al., 2002 ;  Stark et al., 2013 ). It has been previously proposed that oscillatory activity in cortical regions may be entrained due to the rhythmic theta-band output from the hippocampus ( Stark et al., 2013 ;  Colgin, 2016 ).
Several considerations regarding the technical challenges of optogenetic manipulation of HP along the septo-temporal axis need to be made. Besides the inherent difficulties related to the specificity of promoters for selective transfection and the targeting procedure that are ubiquitary for all developing networks and have been addressed elsewhere ( Bitzenhofer et al., 2017a ), confinement of light-sensitive proteins to pyramidal neurons of either dHP or i/vHP required special attention. In a previous study ( Bitzenhofer et al., 2017b ), we developed a selective targeting protocol of neonatal neurons that relies on the combination of CAG promoter and IUE. By these means, the expression of light-sensitive proteins in the neurons located in the neocortical layer and area of interest was sufficiently high to ensure their reliable activation. Similarly, the expression of ChR2(ET/TC) in the pyramidal neurons of hippocampal CA1 area under the CAG promoter was sufficiently high to reliably cause network and neuronal activity. Taking into account that viral transduction, which usually requires 10–14 days for stable expression, is only of limited usability to investigate local network interactions during development, IUE seems to represent the method of choice for manipulating circuits at this early age. IUE enables targeting of precursor cells of neuronal and glial subpopulations, based on their distinct spatial and temporal patterns of generation in the ventricular zone ( Tabata and Nakajima, 2001 ;  Borrell et al., 2005 ;  Niwa et al., 2010 ;  Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2015 ). IUE based on two electrode paddles enabled selective targeting of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of dHP in more than half of the pups per litter ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ), but it completely failed (0 out of 32 mice) to target these neurons in i/vHP. Therefore, it was necessary to use a modified IUE protocol based on three electrodes. This protocol, although more complicated and time consuming, allows reliable transfection at brain locations that are only able to be sporadically targeted by two electrodes The IUE-induced expression of light sensitive proteins enables the reliable firing of neurons in both dHP and i/vHP in response to light pulses. One intriguing question is how many pyramidal neurons in str. pyr. of CA1 area must be synchronously activated to drive the oscillatory entrainment of prelimbic circuitry. Anterograde and retrograde tracing demonstrated the density increase along the septo-temporal axis of hippocampal axons targeting the PL. Light activation/inhibition of these axonal terminals paired with monitoring of network oscillations in the PFC might offer valuable insights into the patterns of coupling sufficient for activation.
Functional relevance of frequency-specific drive within developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks
Abundant literature links theta frequency coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks to cognitive performance and emotional states of adults ( Adhikari et al., 2010 ;  Xu and Südhof, 2013 ;  Spellman et al., 2015 ;  Hallock et al., 2016 ;  Place et al., 2016 ;  Ye et al., 2017 ). The early emergence of directed communication between PFC and i/vHP raises the question of functional relevance of this early coupling during development and at adulthood.
The maturation of cognitive abilities is a process even more protracted than sensory development and starts during second-third postnatal week ( Hanganu-Opatz, 2010 ;  Cirelli and Tononi, 2015 ). Some of these abilities, such as recognition memory, can be easily monitored at early age and seems to critically rely on structurally and functionally intact prefrontal-hippocampal networks ( Krüger et al., 2012 ). Direct assessment of the role of neonatal communication for memory performance as performed for adult circuits is impossible due to the temporal delay of the two processes. The alternative is to manipulate the activity of either PFC, HP or the connectivity between them during defined developmental time windows and monitor the juvenile and adult consequences at structural, functional and behavioral levels. The present data and optogenetic protocol represent the pre-requisite of this investigation, opening new perspectives for assessing the adult behavioral readout of long-range communication in the developing brain.
One question that remains to be addressed is how the hippocampal theta drive shapes the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks. Following the general rules of activity-dependent plasticity ( Hubel et al., 1977 ;  Huberman et al., 2006 ;  Xu et al., 2011 ;  Yasuda et al., 2011 ), the precisely timed excitatory inputs from the i/vHP to the PL might facilitate the wiring of local prefrontal circuitry and enable the refinement of behaviorally relevant communication scaffold between the two regions. By these means, the prefrontal activity driven by projection neurons in the HP act as a template, having a pre-adaptive function that facilitates the tuning of circuits with regard to future conditions. This instructive role of theta activity for the prefrontal circuits needs to be proven by manipulation of temporal structure of the hippocampal drive without affecting the overall level of activity. Understanding the rules that govern the early organization of large-scale networks represents the pre-requisite for identifying the structural and functional deficits related to abnormal behavior and disease.
Combining selective optogenetic activation with extracellular recordings and tracing of projections in neonatal mice in vivo, we provide causal evidence that theta activity in the CA1 area of i/vHP but not dHP drives network oscillations within developing prefrontal cortex. Despite stronger theta power in the dHP, solely optical activation of the pyramidal neurons in i/vHP at theta frequency range (8 Hz) boosted the emergence of discontinuous oscillatory activity in theta and beta-gamma bands in the neonatal PFC. These data identify the cellular substrate of the directed interactions between neonatal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and offer new perspectives for the interrogation of long-range coupling in the developing brain and its behavioral readout.
