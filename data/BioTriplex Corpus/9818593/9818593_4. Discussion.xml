This study reports the anti-hypertensive effect of parboiled germinated brown rice (PGBR) made from the Khao Dawk Mali 105 variety on antioxidant enzymes and gene expression associated with fibrosis in the hearts of hypertensive rats induced by  N -nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME). Clear beneficial results were obtained when the diet was mixed with PGBR. The treatment with PGBR attenuated blood pressure and decreased myocardial degeneration. In several studies, there were no effects of L-NAME on body weight [ 18 , 19 ]. However, increased body weight was observed in the L-NAME group in this study. It could be that the three rice groups of rats consumed higher amounts of food than the control, L-NAME, and drug groups. Therefore, the weights were higher than in the other groups ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). Moreover, the three different rice groups showed increases in body weight. These might be the effects of the difference in energy from the rice diets. The corn starch in the basal diet was substituted with different rice varieties. Therefore, the difference in energy in the rat diets came from the rice types. The rats in the WR, BR, and PGBR groups received 40.0 ± 6.9, 40.8 ± 8.1, and 42.8 ± 9.1 kcal of energy from rice, respectively ( Supplementary Table S2 ).
Previous studies reported that PGBR contained high amounts of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), ferulic acid, γ-oryzanol, γ-tocotrienol, and p-coumaric acid and showed higher antioxidant abilities than white rice and brown rice [ 9 , 10 ]. In agreement with earlier reports, the anti-hypertensive effect of pregerminated brown rice was also evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) fed a diet containing 40% pregerminated brown rice for eight weeks. The results showed anti-hypertensive effects compared to the control group [ 20 ]. In this study, L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats showed a significantly increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) that significantly decreased after treatment with PGBR. The results agreed with the anti-hypertensive effect of PGBR, which contains high contents of bioactive ingredients [ 9 , 20 ], especially GABA and ferulic acid. The mechanism of the hypotensive action of the administered GABA has not yet been fully explained, but GABA showed an anti-hypertensive action as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system [ 14 ], while a low dose of a novel cultivar of GABA-rich tomato had an anti-hypertensive effect in SHRs by reducing SBP compared to the control group in both single- and chronic-administration studies [ 21 ].
The administration of L-NAME, an L-arginine analog, produces hypertension, vascular resistance, hypertrophy, myocardial remodeling, and vasoconstriction. Angiotensin II (Ang II) influences the phases of the inflammatory response involved in the mechanisms leading to vascular remodeling by stimulating vascular repairs such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), hypertrophy, the accumulation of extracellular matrix, and collagen deposition [ 17 ]. Thus, inflammation seems to be closely related and might mediate Ang-II-induced vascular remodeling. Ang II and TGF-β1 stimulate the development of cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, the accumulation of collagen type I (Col I) and collagen type III (Col III), fibrosis, and the structural organization of collagen. The effects of Ang II are either indirect by the upregulation of TGF-β1 expression or direct by Ang II receptors: AT1R [ 6 , 20 ]. All these reports showed relationships among AT1R, TGF-β1, Col I, and Col III that may contribute to myocardial fibrosis in the animal model [ 22 ]. This study demonstrated that treatment with PGBR in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats significantly decreased AT1R, TGF-β1, and Col I gene expression compared to the L-NAME group. The findings indicated that the anti-inflammatory effect of PGBR improved myocardial fibrosis by inhibiting genes involved in the renin–angiotensin system and fibrosis.
Vasoconstriction is also a mechanism leading to hypertension, while the chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) may lead to vasoconstriction [ 18 , 19 ]. Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized in endothelial cells from L-arginine and is converted to NO by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Moreover, the inhibition of eNOS activity leads to increased expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX4), a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vascular tissue. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species decreased antioxidant defense systems and reduced NO bioavailability [ 23 , 24 , 25 ]. The L-NAME treatment decreased the expression of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene after long-term L-NAME treatment, while many studies reported increased eNOS mRNA levels in the heart and kidney in hypertensive rats [ 26 ]. Moreover, L-NAME induced hypertension by involving the renin–angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) [ 27 ]. It was observed that an L-NAME treatment raised eNOS protein levels [ 26 ]. However, in our work, L-NAME had no effect on eNOS mRNA, which might indicate that mRNA is dependable for early responses. Further investigation into the eNOS protein level may be worth pursuing. In this study, treatment with PGBR tended to increase eNOS expression and progressively decreased NOX4 gene expression in the hearts of L-NAME-treated rats, but no significant differences were observed. Therefore, the mechanisms of PGBR that contain bioactive ingredients may be involved in the antioxidant activity and preserve the bioavailability of NO in hypertensive hearts.
The relationship between the development of hypertension, decreased antioxidant capacity, and the increased bioavailability of ROS has been indicated in many experimental models [ 28 ]. Major enzymatic antioxidant defenses include superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) as the primary lines of cellular defense against oxidative damage [ 29 ]. In this study, only GPX expression was induced after L-NAME treatment, while CAT and SOD expression were not different between the control and L-NAME groups, suggesting that GPx might be the main enzyme quenching oxidative stress in hypertensive rats. This effect displayed a compensatory mechanism to attenuate the excessive ROS production [ 30 ]. This result agreed with Kumar et al. (2012) [ 31 ], who found improved GPx activity after treatment with syringic acid in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats. The increased activity of enzymatic antioxidants might be due to free radical scavenging efficacy as a beneficial action against pathophysiological modifications caused by superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals [ 21 ]. These antioxidant genes appeared to fluctuate without being statistically significant. For example, a recent study determined that lead-induced hypertension had no effect on SOD, CAT, or GPx in the hearts of the animals but increase NOX4 [ 32 ], and another study showed that SOD, CAT, and GPx were not changed in the kidneys of hypertensive rats (measured at week 16) [ 33 ].
As the L-NAME raised the expression of NOX4 in L-NAME-treated rats, resulting in an increase in oxidants, we hypothesized that alternative antioxidant enzymes may play an important role in mitigating the oxidative stress caused by L-NAME.
The inflammatory response and cytokines are important components of the host response to heart injury from hypertension and play a key role in cardiac repair [ 34 ], ultimately leading to the replacement of dead myocardium with a collagen-based scar and distorted architecture and function of the heart. Moreover, excess collagen deposition and fibrosis have been linked to myocardial stiffness and systolic and diastolic abnormalities [ 35 , 36 ], suggesting that interstitial myocardial fibrosis may be related to L-NAME-induced vasoconstriction with consequent myocardial ischemia. In this study, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used for the test to examine rat tissue for cardiomyopathy. Some studies reported that the histology results related to biochemical parameters and ECG results [ 37 , 38 , 39 ]. In this study, rats could be induced to be hypertensive, promoting myocardium inflammation and scar deposition. However, when comparing the microscopic findings ( Table 2 ), collagen involving scars, fibrosis in the myocardium, and collagen deposit in the sub-endocardium were not observed in the three rice groups. Only one lesion was found in the L-NAME group. It is possible that the rats had no severity in their heart pathologies, so the markers, such as gene expression, did not show any differences among the rice groups. Our data showed that the PGBR group seemed to have the lowest downregulation in scar deposition gene expression, such Col I and III. Thus, the administration of PGBR not only inhibited the renin–angiotensin system and fibrosis but also improved cardiac histology.
The results from this study suggested that the ingestion of PGBR might protect the heart against L-NAME-induced hypertension. The molecular mechanism of how PRBR reduced hypertension might be (i) the inhibition of the renin–angiotensin axis, (ii) the inhibition of fibrosis, or (iii) the inhibition of oxidative-stress-generating enzymes (NOX) and the activation of an antioxidant enzyme (GPx). Thus, the consumption of PGBR might reduce heart damage from hypertension pathology in this hypertensive rat model. Some study limitations were observed. The diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were not recorded, while the protein expression for several genes was not measured. The variations in oxidative stress and antioxidant genes were observed with no statistical findings. A limitation in this study could be that the food was freely accessed by the rats. The exact rice doses were difficult to calculate. Further studies should investigate more biomarkers, such as antioxidant or anti-inflammatory markers, to further clarify the mechanism of PGBR for the treatment of hypertension.
