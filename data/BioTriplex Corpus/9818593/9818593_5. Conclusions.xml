This is the first report demonstrating the anti-hypertensive properties of parboiled germinated brown rice (PGBR) in  N -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-induced hypertensive rats. PGBR significantly decreased the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and transforming growth factor-β and significantly increased glutathione peroxidase expression. The gene expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 and collagen type I progressively decreased in the PGBR group. Thus, the regular consumption of PGBR could treat hypertension as in this animal model study.
