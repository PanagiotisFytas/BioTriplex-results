Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy with an estimated global population prevalence of 0.46% ( Almutairi et al., 2021 ). RA is characterized by synovial membrane hyperplasia, leukocyte infiltration, and irreversible cartilage and bone destruction in multiple joints. Biological therapies targeting the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) serve as robust treatment options for attenuating chronic inflammation in RA ( Mitoma et al., 2018 ;  Kerschbaumer et al., 2020 ). However, these agents are expensive and 30%–40% of RA patients have inadequate clinical responses ( Rubbert-Roth et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, blocking TNF-α results in broad-spectrum immunosuppression that increases the risk of serious infections and some types of cancer ( Sartori et al., 2019 ;  Sepriano et al., 2020 ;  Li et al., 2021 ). Elucidating molecular pathways downstream of TNF-α may lead to the development of more selective drugs capable of attenuating joint damage without compromising essential immune functions.
The orphan nuclear receptor 4A2 (NR4A2/Nurr1) may be a promising therapeutic target downstream of TNF-α and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Τhis transcription factor is a member of the NR4A family of receptors along with NR4A1 (Nur77) and NR4A3 (NOR1). The NR4A receptors share a high degree of homology and may have functional redundancy in some cellular contexts ( Crean and Murphy, 2021 ). In contrast to other nuclear receptors, the NR4A receptors are presumed to be constitutively active, ligand-independent factors regulated at the level of expression and post-translational modification ( Zhao and Bruemmer, 2010 ). In response to inflammation, NF-κB and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) bind directly to the NR4A2 promoter and rapidly induce its expression in chondrocytes, synoviocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells ( McEvoy et al., 2002 ;  Ralph et al., 2005 ;  Pei et al., 2006 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ). NR4A2 is also highly expressed in inflamed synovial tissues from individuals with RA and psoriatic arthritis as well as in cartilage from individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) ( Murphy et al., 2001 ;  McEvoy et al., 2002 ;  Ralph et al., 2005 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Ralph et al., 2010 ;  Mix et al., 2012 ). Over-expression of NR4A2 in synovial fibroblasts enhances proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and invasion, suggesting critical roles for this receptor in synovial hyperplasia ( Mix et al., 2012 ) .  At the transcriptional level, NR4A2 regulates expression of the chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), cartilage-degrading matrix metalloproteinases-1 and 13 (MMP-1, 13), and the immunomodulatory peptide hormone prolactin ( Davies et al., 2005 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Mix et al., 2012 ;  McCoy et al., 2015 ). While analyses of human joint tissues and cells have yielded important insight into NR4A2-dependent mechanisms, a comprehensive analysis of receptor mRNA expression levels and protein distribution has not been performed in an animal model of arthritis.
This study provides a detailed analysis of gene expression levels and joint tissue distribution patterns of the NR4A receptors and NF-κB in a transgenic mouse model of RA driven by chronic expression of the human TNF-α cytokine (hTNF-α, Taconic model 1006). Transgenic models expressing hTNF-α have demonstrated great utility for pre-clinical validation of therapies and insight into RA mechanisms ( Douni et al., 2004 ;  Zwerina et al., 2004 ;  Delavallée et al., 2009 ;  Binder et al., 2013 ;  Li et al., 2016 ;  Karagianni et al., 2019 ;  Ubah et al., 2019 ). The hTNF-α transgenic mice studied here exhibit spontaneous and progressive inflammation leading to severe polyarthritis by 20 weeks of age. Since TNF-α is a potent inducer of NF-κB and NR4A2 in human joint cells, we hypothesized that these transcription factors would also be upregulated and active during disease progression in the hTNF-α model. To test this, we quantified NR4A1-3 and NF-κB mRNA levels by RT-qPCR and measured protein distribution by immunohistochemistry in joints from hTNF-α mice at different disease stages. In addition, a broader screen of RA-related genes was conducted and potential NR4A and NF-κB target genes were identified through promoter analyses. Our results provide the first spatiotemporal map of NR4A2 distribution in an animal model of RA and validate the hTNF-α model for testing of small molecules and genetic therapies targeting this transcription factor.
