Animals
Male hTNF-α transgenic and C57BL6/N wild-type mice were obtained from Taconic Biosciences (Model 1006; Hudson, NY, United States). The hTNF-α model was generated using a 2.8 kb transgene containing the human TNF-α gene with the full-length promoter and coding region. The endogenous 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the human TNF-α gene was replaced with the human beta-globin 3′ UTR which served to stabilize the transcript ( Keffer et al., 1991 ). The transgenic line was produced by pronuclear microinjection of B6SLJ (F2) hybrid zygotes and mice were backcrossed for over 20 generations onto the C57BL6/N genetic background. For this study, transgenic and wild-type littermates were maintained at Taconic Biosciences until 8 ( n  = 5), 12 ( n  = 4), and 19 weeks of age ( n  = 4), representing early, established, and late stages of RA ( Taconic Biosciences, 2022 ). Mice were group-housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light cycle and access to food and water ad libitum. At the end of the study, body mass was measured and clinical scores were assessed by Taconic Biosciences using a 24-point scoring system as follows: 20 digits scored as 0 (normal) or 0.2 (one or more swollen joints) for a maximum total digit score of 4, each paw scored as 0 (normal), 1 (noticeably swollen) or 2 (severely swollen) for a maximum total paw score of 8, each wrist scored as 0 (normal), 1 (noticeably swollen), or 2 (severely swollen) for a maximum total wrist score of 4 and each ankle scored as 0 (normal), 2 (noticeably swollen), or 4 (severely swollen) for a maximum total ankle score of 8 ( Taconic Biosciences, 2022 ). Immediately after euthanasia, paws were dissected proximal to the ankle/wrist joints and transferred to RNAlater (left paws) and 10% neutral buffered formalin (right paws) for RT-qPCR and histology, respectively. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Taconic Biosciences and Loyola University New Orleans.
Immunohistochemistry and Imaging
Hind paws ( n  = 13 per genotype) were fixed in neutral-buffered formalin followed by decalcification with formic acid-based Decalcifier I (Leica), paraffin processed and embedded sagittally for microtomy. Serial 5 µm-thick sections were cut and mounted on Trubond 380 slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Slides were then heated for 45 min at 59°C, deparaffinized, re-hydrated, and formaldehyde cross-links were dissociated by submerging slides in pressure-heated citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Endogenous peroxidases were removed by treatment with 3% H 2 O 2  in methanol and non-specific binding was reduced by incubation in Protein Block (Abcam). Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with either rabbit polyclonal anti-NR4A2 (Novus NB110-40415), rabbit monoclonal anti-RelA (Abcam ab32536), rabbit IgG isotype control (Abcam 172730) or antibody diluent only. After washing, sections were incubated for 30 min in anti-rabbit Ig (H + L) secondary conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Vector ImPRESS). The reaction product of Diaminobenzidine and H 2 O 2  was used as substrate to visualize the tagged epitopes. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and images collected with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a digital camera driven by CellSens software (Olympus). Semi-quantitative scoring of RelA and NR4A2-positive cells in synovium and cartilage from at least two 400× fields per section was conducted by two blinded observers. Representative images from hTNF-α and wild-type joints at 400× magnification are shown.
RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR
Contralateral paws were dissected proximal to the ankle/wrist joints and the skin was removed. Tissue was coarsely minced with a scalpel and homogenized with a TissueTearor (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ, United States). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy fibrous tissue mini columns (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, United States), eluted into RNase-free water and quantified with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the iSCRIPT reverse transcriptase master mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). Twenty microliter reactions were prepared with 1 µg of total RNA from each paw (50 ng/µl cDNA). Control reactions were prepared with the negative control master mix provided with the kit. Reactions were incubated in a Bio-Rad C1000 thermocycler for 5 min at 25°C, 30 min at 42°C, and 5 min at 85°C. Quantitative PCR was performed using iTaq Universal SYBR Green SuperMix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and validated primers spanning exon-intron junctions in the mouse TATA-Box Binding Protein (TBP), NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, and NF-κB 1  genes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). Twenty microliter reactions were prepared in triplicate with 50 ng of cDNA from each sample and incubated in a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) for 30 s at 95°C, 5 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C (40 cycles), followed by melting curve analysis from 65°C–95°C using CFX Manager Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). Relative gene expression was calculated by the 2 −ΔΔCt  method ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ) with target gene levels normalized to TBP.
RT-qPCR Panels and Promoter Analysis
Pre-designed PrimePCR panels were used to analyze 88 mouse genes associated with RA and reference genes (Rheumatoid Arthritis Tier 1 M96, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). Pooled cDNA from transgenic or wild-type paws ( n  = 4/group) at early or late time points was mixed with iTaq Universal SYBR Green SuperMix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and added to each well of the PrimePCR reaction plates containing lyophilized primers. Reactions were incubated for 30 s at 95°C, 5 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C (40 cycles), followed by melting curve analysis from 65°C–95°C. Target gene expression was normalized to TBP and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using the gene study analysis in the CFX Manager Software. Control assays included on each PrimePCR plate confirmed RNA integrity and the absence of contaminating genomic DNA. Thresholds for induced and repressed genes in hTNF-α mice were set at a >2-fold increase or a >0.5-fold decrease, respectively. Genes were classified as stable if fold-change values were between these thresholds. LASAGNA (Length-Aware Site Alignment Guided by Nucleotide Association)-Search, an integrated web tool for predicting transcription factor binding sites with the LASAGNA algorithm, was used to analyze gene promoters in all expressed genes ( Lee and Huang, 2013 ). Promoter regions of mouse genes (−1,000 bp to 0) were scanned for NR4A2 (AAGGTCAC) and NF-κB 1  (GGGGATTCCCC) binding sites using matrix derived JASPAR CORE models of consensus vertebrate binding sites, with a  p -value threshold of <0.001.
Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism software (version 9.3.1) was used to generate graphs and compare gene and protein expression data between groups of age-matched transgenic and wild-type mice. Normality was confirmed with the D’Agostino-Pearson test and the unpaired  t -test was applied to data in  Figures 1 ,  3 ,  4  with the threshold of statistical significance at  p  < 0.05. The Mann Whitney test was used to analyze RT-qPCR data with deviations from normality in  Figure 2  with a threshold of statistical significance at  p  < 0.05.
