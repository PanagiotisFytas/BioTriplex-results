mRNA expression of the EGF receptors in gastric cancer
RNA extracted from 38 tumors and matched samples from the adjacent normal tissue from patients who underwent surgery for gastric cancer was used for RT-qPCR quantifications. The mRNA expression of the four EGF family receptors EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4 is depicted in  Figure 1 . Interestingly, the HER4 receptor was subjected to downregulation in the cancerous tissue compared to the normal tissue (p = 0.0004). For HER2, we saw an upregulation of this receptor in the cancerous tissue that was very close to being significant (p = 0.0520). EGFR and HER3 mRNA expression was un-changed in the tumors compared to the normal tissue.
HER4 exists as different alternatively spliced isoforms. The juxtamembranous region can consist of either JMa or JMb, and the cytoplasmic region can consist of either CYT1 or CYT2. The downregulation observed for total HER4 mRNA expression in cancerous tissue applied to all four variants of the receptor ( Figure 2 ).
To better illustrate the magnitude of HER4 downregulation in the tumor tissue, we plotted the HER4 down- or upregulation for each individual patient. The HER4 mRNA expression in the tumor tissue minus the HER4 mRNA expression in the matched normal tissue (ΔHER4) is depicted in  Figure 3 . A value below 0 represents a downregulation. This figure clearly illustrates that HER4 downregulation is a very general mechanism that takes place in the majority of the patients and regardless of tumor localization.
mRNA expression of the EGF family ligands in gastric cancer
TGF-α, amphiregulin, and EGF specifically bind EGFR. A negligible mRNA expression level was detected for EGF in both tumor and normal tissue, and therefore this ligand was not considered for further analysis. TGF-α and amphiregulin were both upregulated in the cancerous tissue compared to the normal tissue ( Figures 4a and b ). HB-EGF, betacellulin, and epiregulin have affinity for both EGFR and HER4, and all of these ligands were also upregulated in the cancerous tissue ( Figures 4  c, d, and e). Taken together, this shows that all EGFR-activating ligands are upregulated in the tumors.
Of the neuregulins, NRG1 and NRG2 bind both HER3 and HER4. We observed no change in expression of either the α or the β variants of NRG1 and NRG2 ( Figures 4f, g, h and i ). NRG3 and NRG4 only bind HER4. NRG3 did not undergo any change in expression from normal to cancerous tissue ( Figure 4j ). However, NRG4 was downregulated in the cancerous tissue compared to the normal tissue (p = 0.0009) ( Figure 4k ). This demonstrates that both HER4 and its specific ligand NRG4 are down-regulated in gastric cancer.
To better illustrate the magnitude of NRG4 downregulation in the tumor tissue, we plotted the NRG4 down- or upregulation for each individual patient. The NRG4 mRNA expression in the tumor tissue minus the NRG4 mRNA expression in the matched normal tissue (ΔNRG4) is depicted in  Figure 5 .
Considering all the patients showing downregulation of total HER4 in their tumor tissue, in 82% of these NRG4 was also downregulation and in 86% one or more of the EGFR-shared ligands (HB-EGF, epiregulin, betacellulin) was upregulated. In 36% of the patients with total HER4 downregulation, all three of the EGFR shared ligands were upregulated.
Protein expression of HER by immunohistochemistry
Because of post-transcriptional regulations, the mRNA expression patterns determined by RT-qPCR might not represent the protein expression pattern. To ensure that the observed decrease in HER4 mRNA expression in the cancerous tissue of patients with gastric cancer is also reflected on the protein level, we performed immunohistochemical staining on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from all patients included in the study.
By a quantification of the HER4 staining intensity in representative areas of the tumor- and the surrounding tissue, we found the tumor tissue to have significantly less HER4 staining intensity compared to the surrounding normal mucosa (p = 0.0029) ( Figure 6 ).
Representative photomicrographs of the stainings are presented in  Figure 7 . In the normal gastric mucosa there was a strong HER4 immunoreaction ( Figure 7  a). Especially the basal part of the cytoplasm and the lateral cell membrane of the surface epithelial cells were strongly immunoreactive for HER4 ( Figure 5  b). Also the parietal cells showed very strong HER4 immunoreactivity ( Figure 7  c and d). The submucosa and muscle layers were negative. In the glandular structures especially the parietal cells showed very strong HER4 immunoreactivity ( Figures 7  c and d). Negative controls performed without any primary antibody resulted in no staining.
In the gastric cancers only minor areas with tumor cells had a positive immunoreaction to HER4, and the negative tumor tissue contrasted strongly with the stained normal mucosa adjacent to the tumor ( Figure 7 ). In the central parts of the tumor tissue almost all cells were completely negative apart from small clusters of cells which might have had a distinct membrane staining.
