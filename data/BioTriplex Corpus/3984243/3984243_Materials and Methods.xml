Patient selection and collection of biopsies
In this cohort study, 38 patients undergoing surgery for adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagus or gastroesophageal junction were consecutively included from July 2008 to November 2009. All individuals provided an informed written consent. Collection of biopsies was approved by the regional scientific ethics committees of Zealand, Denmark (journal number H-B-2008-049), and the establishment of a biobank was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (journal number 2008-41-2138). Biopsies were taken from both tumor tissue and the adjacent normal tissue. All biopsy samples were reviewed by an experienced pathologist to validate the diagnosis. Pre-defined clinical data were extracted from medical charts and pathology reports. The clinical characteristics of the patients are given in  Table 1 .

RNA extraction
Biopsies were placed in RNA later  (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) immediately after removal. RNA later  was removed prior to RNA isolation, and Trizol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added. The tissue samples were homogenized on a Tissuelyser (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA). RNA from tissue was isolated according to the manufacture's protocol for Trizol RNA isolation (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA concentrations were measured on a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. RNA quality was tested on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacture's protocol.
Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-q-PCR)
cDNA was synthesized from 1 ug total RNA using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The final reaction was diluted to a total volume of 200 uL.
1 µl of cDNA was used for qPCR using SYBR green Master mix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) on a Roche lightcycler 480 at: 95°C, 10 min; 50 cycles of 95°C for 10 sec, specific annealing temperature for 10 sec, 72°C for 5 sec; 99°C for 1 sec; 59°C for 15 sec; 95°C for 1 sec; cooling to 40°C. Primer sequences and annealing temperatures are given in  Table 2 .

The gene best suited for normalization was determined by applying the Normfinder algorithm  [23]  to the quantified concentrations of GAPDH, β-actin, YWHAZ, SDHA, and HMBS. SDHA turned out to be the best of the five. Two samples were excluded from the analyses due to no detection of mRNA from any of the reference genes.
Immunostaining
Paraffin-embedded tissues fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde from 13 representative patients were investigated by immunohistochemistry using c-erbB-4/HER-4, rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted 1/50 as the primary antibody (RB-9045-P1, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). For antigen retrieval sections were boiled in micro wave oven in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0. The immunoreaction was visualized by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1/200 (BA-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), followed by a preformed avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase macromolecular complex (ABC) diluted 1/100 (Code nr. PK-4000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The reaction was developed by the use of 3,3 -diaminobenzidine and counterstaining was performed with Mayer's Hemalum. As a negative control, the same procedure was conducted without any primary antibody.
Using Image Pro Plus (MediaCybernetics) the staining intensity of representative images of the tumor versus the surrounding mucosa tissue was estimated. Two images of tumor sample and two images of the surrounding mucosa were collected from each tissue sample and the average of the two values was calculated and used for statistical analysis and plotting. For a few samples, only tumor tissue or only normal mucosa was present and no comparison of HER4 expression was possible for these tissues. Paired t-test was used to determine if the intensity of the tumor tissues was different from the intensity of the mucosa tissues.
