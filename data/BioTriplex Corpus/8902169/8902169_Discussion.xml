Brucellosis is a globally distributed zoonotic bacterial disease caused by the  Brucellaceae  family in the alpha-2 subclass of  Proteobacteria. B. melitensis  is an etiological agent that mainly affects goats and sheep and leads to substantial economic losses in the animal industry, such as decreased fertility, loss of young, and decreased milk production.  B. melitensis  is also the most virulent species in humans and it significantly affects human health.  B.suis  S2 is extensively used as an oral vaccine in China to prevent ovine and caprine brucellosis. Mice are the premier mammalian model system for  Brucella -induced immunity research because of their close genetic and physiological similarities to sheep and the ease by which the mouse genome can be manipulated and analyzed ( 6 ). However, the use of mouse models may influence the identification of sheep-specific immune response genes and clinical markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of brucellosis. The study on the immunological mechanisms of vaccine-induced protection against  Brucella  in sheep remains comparatively rare. Identifying functional molecules involved in the host immune response will deepen our understanding of further research on optimizing vaccines and developing molecular diagnostic targets.
MiRNAs have been proven to participate in brucellosis immunopathogenesis. Our previous studies found that the autophagic pathway associated miRNAs, mmu-miR-146b-5p and mmu-miR-149-3p was up-regulated and down-regulated in RAW264.7 macrophage cells infected with  B.melitensis  M5-90 mutant strain, respectively ( 18 ,  19 ). In  B.melitensis -infected goat fibroblasts, we found that miR-744, miR-29a-5p and miR-193b-5p play pleiotropic roles in inflammatory and immune responses ( 20 ). To uncover the host miRNA-driven defense mechanism in sheep, we investigated the  in vivo  changes in sheep immunized with  B.suis  S2. The sheep were orally immunized with 1 mL of diluted  B.suis  S2 (2 × 10 10  CFU) in a biosafety level III facility. All animals were monitored daily for 90 consecutive dpi. Fiebig et.al demonstrated that  B. abortus  introduced conjunctivally could be detected in the retropharyngeal lymph nodes of cattle between 7 and 21 dpi ( 31 ). In our study, we collected the submandibular lymphatic nodes of sheep seropositive for  Brucella  at 7, 14, 21, 30, 60, and 90 dpi. MicroRNA sequencing revealed that 282 differentially expressed miRNAs were significantly enriched in immune pathways, especially in innate and adaptive immunity pathways. According to the alignment results and RT-qPCR experiment, three novel differentially expressed miRNAs were identified: novel_229, novel_609 and novel_973. After immunization with  B.suis  S2 vaccine, the expressions of these miRNAs declined at least twice. The expressions of novel_229 and novel_973 decreased from 7 dpi to 30 dpi. At 60 dpi, the expression level of novel_229 continued to decrease, as well as novel_973 increased. The expression of novel_609 peaked at 14 dpi and maintained a lower level from 21 dpi to 90 dpi. The IgG antibodies peaked by day 14 after the first immunization and remained the level from 14 dpi to 90 dpi. The correlation between novel miRNAs expression and antibody levels needs to be validated prospectively. Functional analyses of these miRNAs revealed that they participated in immune response pathways, including the innate and adaptive immunity pathways. Notably, nine target genes of these novel miRNAs were involved in the innate immunity.
The immune-related target genes of novel_229 included  ENSOARG00000000649  and  TMED1 .  ENSOARG00000000649  encoded peptidase M12B domain, which was associated with the Notch signaling pathway. Several studies have shown that during bacterial infections, Notch signaling pathways modulate the CD4 +  T cells' function and regulate T cell polarization ( 32 ). The protein encoded by  TMED1  is a member of the p24 family of trafficking proteins, and recent research revealed that TMED1, RNF26, TMEM43, TMEM33 and ENDOD1 form a complex that modulates innate immune signaling through the cGAS-STING pathway ( 33 ).
  and  PDPK1  were immune-related target genes of novel_609.  LPO  gene encodes a member of the peroxidase family of proteins which catalyzes the generation of the antimicrobial substance hypothiocyanous acid ( 34 ). Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, is an innate immune protein that skews different types of macrophages toward M1 activation and induces the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation by activating the NF-κB-STAT3 loop ( 35 ).  PDPK1  encodes 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, which is associated with PI3Kδ inhibition, consistently improved function and significantly increased bacterial killing of neutrophils ( 36 ).
The immune-related target genes of novel_973 included  CCL28, FGB, C6orf58, SPPL3, BPIFB1, ENSOARG00000021083, MPTX1, OLR1, ENSOARG00000020393  and  IDO1 . Two genes ( CCL28  and  FGB ) were associated with both innate and adaptive immunity pathways.  CCL28  encodes CCL28, a cellular component chemokine (β-chemokine) and drives the mucosal homing of T and B lymphocytes ( 37 ). This chemokine plays dual roles in antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. High CCL28 expression levels provide a constitutive innate immune defense against various bacterial pathogens and strengthen the protein's involvement in antimicrobial activity ( 38 ).  FGB  encodes the fibrinogen beta chain, which is associated with host defense at an early stage of the infectious process and facilitates antibacterial immune responses via both innate and T-cell-mediated pathways ( 39 ,  40 ). Fibrinogen plays a key role in determining the outcomes of sepsis, and higher fibrinogen levels are associated with better outcomes ( 41 ). In our study,  C6orf58, SPPL3, BPIFB1, ENSOARG00000021083  and  MPTX1  may have been induced by the downregulation of novel_973, suggesting that host innate immunity was activated after immunization with  B. suis  strain S2. Signal peptide peptidase-like 3 (SPPL3) is a member of the intramembrane aspartyl protease family, which functions in the endoplasmic reticulum in T cells to promote store-operated calcium entry in response to T-cell receptor engagement by enhancing the interaction between STIM1 and Orai1 ( 42 ,  43 ). Bactericidal/permeability-increasing (BPI)-fold-containing family B member 1 (BPIFB1) belongs to the BPI-fold-containing family and is considered to contribute to innate immunity through its structural similarity with BPI protein and LPS-binding protein, both of which are innate immune molecules with recognized roles in sensing and responding to Gram-negative bacteria ( 44 ). The target gene  IDO1  of novel_973 encodes an intracellular enzyme that catalyzes the early stage of tryptophan catabolism along the kynurenine pathway. IDO-1 affects immunity through two nonexclusive mechanisms: establishment of a local response with amino acid deprivation, which inhibits pathogen growth, and production of tryptophan metabolites with immunomodulatory functions or cytotoxic agents that inhibit T-cell activation and modulate differentiation of naive T cells into regulatory T cells ( 45 ).
Moreover, previous research found that miR-181 expression  in vivo  led to substantial increases in both B-lymphoid (CD19 + ) cell and cytotoxic T-cell (CD8 + ) development in the thymus ( 46 ). Members of the miR-181 family have been shown to be dynamically regulated depend on the T-cell activation stage ( 15 ). During  B. suis  infection, miR-181a-5p expression was induced in porcine and murine macrophages, suggesting that miR-181a-5p may be involved in adaptive immunity ( 16 ). However, in our experiment, oar-miR-181a expression was decreased after immunizing sheep with  B. suis  strain S2, which requires further confirmation with additional technologies. Four target genes of oar-miR-181a participated in innate immunity, which were  ENSOARG00000002722, ARHGEF2, MFAP4  and  DOK2. ENSOARG00000002722  encodes complement C4-like protein, which is the key molecule in the complement system. Complement C4 is one of the chief constituents of innate immunity for immediate recognition and elimination of invading microbes, and plays an essential role in the functions of both classical and lectin complement pathways ( 47 ).  ARHGEF2  encodes the microtubule-associated immune molecule guanine nucleotide exchange factor-H1 (GEF-H1), which is crucial in coupling microtubule dynamics to the initiation of microtubule-mediated immune responses ( 48 ). Microfibril-associated glycoprotein 4 (MFAP4), a pattern recognition-like molecule with a fibrinogen-like domain (FBG), has the ability to recognize and agglutinate pathogens, playing an essential role in host innate immune defense ( 49 ,  50 ). Dok2, which belongs to the protein tyrosine kinases family, is the negative regulator of innate immunity in the early inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide  in vivo  ( 51 ). These results enable better understanding of the immune responses of sheep upon  B.suis  S2 vaccination and the roles of miRNAs in host innate and adaptive immunity, which provides valuable information for preventing brucellosis.
