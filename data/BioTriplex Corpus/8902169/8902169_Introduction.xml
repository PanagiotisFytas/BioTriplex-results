Brucellosis, caused by infection with  Brucella  spp., is among the most common bacterial zoonoses.  Brucella  spp. infect both humans and non-human animals, including sheep, goats, cattle, swine and a variety of feral animals. Globally, over half a million humans are infected annually ( 1 ). Malta fever, chronic debilitating disease, spontaneous abortions and sterility are the main clinical symptoms of brucellosis. The disease tends to be chronic and persistent, which causes its host to become febrile and masquerades as many other diseases ( 2 ). Brucellosis in domestic animals, especially in ovine and caprine herds, causes adverse economic effects on animal production and affects public health ( 3 ). Vaccine inoculation is an effective preventive measure. Since 1971, the  Brucella suis  strain 2 ( B.suis  S2) vaccine has been used successfully in China to orally vaccinate sheep and goats against brucellosis ( 4 ).
Recently, studies have increasingly reported the mechanisms of  B.suis  S2 vaccine-elicited immune protection. On the one hand, focusing on  Brucella , the comparative genomic analyses of  B.suis  S2 were conducted to study their genetic basis for virulence attenuation. Di and his colleagues found that  eryD  and  OmaA  genes in the  B.suis  S2 genome were related to the virulence attenuation ( 5 ). On the other hand, focusing on the host, the immune responses of different host cells infected with  B.suis  S2 were analyzed, which has prompted the further application of this vaccine in a natural host. Transcriptome analysis of murine macrophages infected with  B.suis  S2 revealed that 11 differently expressed genes were related to the cellular responses to lipopolysaccharide pathway and were significantly upregulated in  B.suis  S2-infected macrophages ( 6 ). Wang et al. observed that the replication of  B.suis  S2 induced goat trophoblast cell apoptosis and growth retardation under endoplasmic reticular stress ( 7 ). In human microglia clone 3 (HMC3) cells,  B.suis  S2 inhibited the JNK/p53 signaling pathway and suppressed apoptosis by increasing CALR protein expression ( 8 ). Recent transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from monkeys immunized with the S2 vaccine showed that most downregulated genes were related to cell adhesion molecules, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and chemokine signaling pathways ( 9 ). However, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in vaccine-mediated protection  in vivo  remains incomplete, especially in ovine herds.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, noncoding RNAs that regulate the post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. It has been stated that miRNAs have a crucial role in the immune evasion of  Brucella  spp ( 10 ). Recent studies have shown that miRNAs, such as miR-125b-5p and miR-24, can activate the NF-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and inhibit the expression of the  STING  gene, thereby influencing bacterial intracellular survival ( 11 ,  12 ). In  Brucella -infected macrophages, the downregulation of miR-21-5p reduced  IL-10  gene expression and increased the expressions of GBP5 and IL-12, thus inhibiting  Brucella  intracellular growth ( 13 ,  14 ). The miR-181 family has been proven to be dynamically regulated during T-cell development and activation ( 15 ). During the  B. suis  1330 infection, miR-181a-5p expression was induced in porcine and murine macrophages, suggesting that miR-181a-5p may be involved in adaptive immunity ( 16 ). Additionally, Zhang et al. identified high miR-103b expression levels in the sera of patients with confirmed brucellosis, providing a reference for the auxiliary diagnoses of brucellosis infections ( 17 ).
We previously found that infecting RAW264.7 macrophages with  B. melitensis  Δ Omp25  altered the expressions of miR-149-3p and miR-146a-5p, and the target genes of miR-149-3p were related to the host immune responses, autophagy and phagosome maturation ( 18 ). After infection with  B. melitensis  M5-90 Δper, the increased expression of miR-146b-5p inhibited autophagy activation in RAW264.7 cells ( 19 ). In goat fibroblasts, we presented a comprehensive miRNA profile in response to  B. melitensis  M5-90 infection and observed that three miRNAs (miR-744, miR-29a-5p and miR-193b-5p) played pleiotropic roles in inflammatory and immune responses ( 20 ). Most organisms contain numerous miRNAs; for example, ~1000 miRNAs were identified within the human genome ( 21 ). However, our understanding of ovine miRNAs is very limited. Using next-generation sequencing technology, Wong et al. detected 353 miRNAs in high abundance. Among them, 89 were the novel ovine miRNAs, which showed 70–99% alignment with hsa-, mmu- and/or rno-miRNAs, and 78 were the previously known oar-miRNAs (in miRBase v21) ( 22 ). The lack of information limits determining the immune mechanisms of sheep against pathogens and vaccines, including  B.suis  S2.
Given the knowledge of miRNAs associated with immunological processes, we hypothesized that miRNAs might also play key roles in  B.suis  S2 vaccine-induced immunity  in vivo . Here, we performed clinical trials using sheep vaccinated with the  B.suis  S2 vaccine and monitored them for 90 consecutive days post-immunization (dpi). The high-throughput miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) technology were applied to reveal the dynamic miRNA expression profiles from the lymph nodes of vaccinated sheep focusing on the novel miRNAs. We identified three novel downregulated miRNAs involved in the immune response. We aimed to identify the roles of these novel ovine miRNAs in the immune responses to the  B.suis  S2 vaccination and provide valuable information for vaccine research on brucellosis.
