Animals and Ethics Statement
Twenty-one 10-month-old unmated female sheep serologically free of  Brucella -specific antibodies were transported to the Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory of Jinyu Baoling Bio-pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Inner Mongolia, China) for experiment. Sheep were serologically tested using the Pourquier ®  Rose Bengal Brucellosis Antigen (IDEXX, P00215, ME, USA) and AsurDx TM  Brucella Multispecies Antibodies cELISA Test Kit (BIOSTONE, 10043-05, TX, USA). Sheep were kept in raised cages separately to prevent cross-transmission of infection and were offered  ad libitum  feeding. Animals were randomly divided into seven groups ( n  = 3): one control group (C group) and six groups inoculated with  Brucella. suis  strain S2 (E1 group to E6 group). At indicated time points post infection, sheep were slaughtered humanely ( Figure 1 ). All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals (Ministry of Science and Technology, China, 2004) and were approved by the Academic Committee of the College of Animal Science and Technology of Hainan University as per the regulations on the use of experimental animals and institutional safety procedures.
Oral Immunization and Sample Collection
In the control group, three sheep were inoculated with 1 mL sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). The remaining 18 sheep were immunized with the lyophilized  B.suis  S2 vaccine (with an amount of 2 × 10 10  CFU) via oral administration. The number of colony-forming units (CFUs) of  B.suis  S2 was determined by plating serial dilutions on plate count agar plates and 2 × 10 10  CFU in 1 mL sterilized PBS (pH 7.2) was used. The vaccine was provided by Jinyu Baoling Bio-pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Inner Mongolia, China). As shown in  Figure 1 , the ovine submandibular lymphatic nodes from the control group and vaccinated groups were collected at 0, 7, 14, 21, 30, 60 and 90 days post-immunization (dpi) individually. RNA was extracted using the standard TRIzol (15596026, Invitrogen, USA) reagent protocol, and DNase I was used to remove contaminating gDNA. RNA degradation and contamination were monitored on 1% agarose gels and checked using the NanoPhotometer ®  spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA). The RNA concentration was measured using the Qubit ®  RNA Assay Kit in Qubit ®  2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The raw reads were deposited to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under accession no. PRJNA775839.
Quantification of  Brucella  Antibodies in Serum
Ovine serum samples were collected prior to the first immunization and at 7, 14, 21, 30, 60, and 90 dpi. Serum samples were tested using the Pourquier ®  Rose Bengal Brucellosis Antigen (IDEXX, P00215, ME, USA) and AsurDx TM  Brucella Multispecies Antibodies cELISA Test Kit (BIOSTONE, 10043-05, TX, USA). In the Rose Bengal Test (RBT) assay, 25 μL of each serum was dispensed on the plates. The same volume of Rose Bengal Brucellosis Antigen was added beside each sample. The serum and Rose Bengal Brucellosis Antigen were mixed to produce a circular 2 cm in diameter. The plates were shaken gently for 4 min to read the results. The competitive ELISA (cELISA) tests were carried out on 96-well microplates. In each well, 10 μL of serum was added to 40 μL of 1 × diluent solution to obtain a 1:5 dilution. Then, 50 μL of 1 × Anti-Brucella Antibody-HRP Conjugate was added. Finally, after 1 h incubation and washing, the reaction was revealed by adding 100 μL/well of TMB substrate and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. 100 μL of Stop Solution was added to each well of the plate. The OD value was read at 450 nm wavelength in a Multiskan ®  FC reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc,). Each serum was processed in quadruplicate. Results were analyzed in terms of Percentage of inhibition (PI), defined as: PI = (1-OD 450  test sample / mean OD 450  negative control) * 100.
Small RNA Sequencing and Normalization
3 μg total RNAs per sample were used to construct the small RNA libraries. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext ®  Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina ®  (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA), and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. The library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. Index-coded samples were clustered on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (GD-401-3001, Illumina, CA, USA). After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500/2000 platform to generate 50-bp single-end reads. Raw data in fastq format was first processed through custom perl and python scripts. In this step, clean reads were obtained by removing reads containing poly-N, with 5′ adapter contaminants, without the 3′ adapter or the insert tag, containing poly A or T or G or C and low-quality reads from the raw data. Q20, Q30, and the GC content of the raw data were calculated. The genome assembly corresponded to GenBank Assembly ID GCA_000298735.1. A specified portion of the clean reads was used to perform all downstream analyses. The small RNA tags were mapped to the reference sequences in Bowtie ( 23 ) without mismatches to analyze their expressions and distributions on the reference. To remove tags originating from protein-coding genes, repeat sequences, rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA, small RNA tags were mapped to RepeatMasker, the Rfam database or data from the specified species. Mapped small RNA tags were used to look for known miRNA. miRBase20.0 was used as a reference, and the modified software miRDeep2 ( 24 ) and srna-tools-cli were used to obtain the potential miRNA and draw the secondary structures. The unannotated sRNAs, which had the characteristics of the hairpin structure of the miRNA precursor, were used to predict novel miRNAs via miREvo ( 25 ) and miRDeep2. Custom scripts were used to obtain the identified miRNA counts and base biases on the first position with a certain length and on each position of all identified miRNAs. The miRNA read counts were normalized as transcripts per million based on the formula: normalized expression = mapped read count/total reads ×1,000,000 ( 26 ).
Differential Expression and Enrichment Analysis
Differential expressions of two groups were analyzed using the DESeq R package (1.8.3).  P -values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. A default corrected  P -value of 0.05 was set as the threshold for significantly differential expressions. In order to identify the function of these miRNAs, the candidate target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) systems. The Wallenius' non-central hyper-geometric distribution, which adjusts the gene length bias, was implemented for GO enrichment analysis ( 27 ). KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of biological systems, such as cells, organisms and ecosystems, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ ) ( 28 ). KOBAS software was used to test the statistical enrichment of the target genes in KEGG pathways ( 29 ).
Novel miRNAs and Target Gene Identification
RT-qPCR was used to verify the reliability of miRNA sequencing. Total RNAs were isolated from the submandibular lymphatic nodes by using TRIzol reagent (15596026, Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The left and right submandibular lymphatic nodes of sheep were collected, respectively. In the E4 group, the right submandibular lymphatic node of No.244 sheep was deficient. The miRcute Plus miRNA First-Strand cDNA Kit (KR211, TIANGEN, Beijing, China) was used to reverse transcribe total RNAs. RT-qPCR was conducted following the protocol from the miRcute Plus miRNA qPCR Kit (FP411, TIANGEN, Beijing, China). The specific stem-loop reverse primer sequence was 5′-AGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTA-3′. The expression levels of target miRNAs were normalized to  U6 . Relative transcriptional levels were determined using the 2 ΔCt −Δ  method. The experiments were repeated three times. All RT-qPCR results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean.  T -tests were performed on the RT-qPCR data to determine whether the difference was statistically significant ( 30 ).  P  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted via Targetscan (-cps 50 -en−10), miRanda (-sc 140 -en−10 -scale 4 -strict) and RNAhybrid (-e−10 -p 0.05 -m 50000). After applying these filters, the residual miRNAs and target genes were used to construct miRNA-mRNA networks using Cytoscape 3.8.2 software.
