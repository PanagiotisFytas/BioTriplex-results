Gpx3 is upregulated in BALF and tissue in the mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis
Initially, in order to assess expression and regulation of lung-abundant extracellular antioxidant proteins, we extracted the relevant data from a previously published proteomic study on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis 35 . Lung-abundant antioxidant proteins with known extracellular location include Gpx1 36 , Gpx3 32 33 , Sod3 37 , peroxiredoxin IV (Prdx4) 31 , and peroxiredoxin VI (Prdx6) 38 . All of these, except for Prdx6, were highly abundant in BALF of control mice under basal conditions ( Fig. 1A , left-hand panel) and Gpx3 and Sod3 were additionally upregulated in BALF during bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis ( Fig. 1B ). As protein abundance of Gpx3 in BALF under normal conditions was substantially higher than for Gpx1 ( Fig. 1A , left-hand panel, appr. 5 times higher), we reasoned that selenium-dependent Gpx activity in BALF should reflect GPX3 activity. In agreement, selenium-dependent Gpx activity was significantly increased 7 and 14 days after bleomycin instillation and returned to baseline thereafter ( Fig. 1C ). Finally, both BALF Gpx3 levels as well as Gpx activity in BALF showed anti-correlation with lung function (Spearman r = −0.4135, p = 0.0699 for Gpx3 protein; Spearman r = −0.7152, p = 0.0006 for Gpx activity;  Fig. 1D ).
In lung tissue, all antioxidant proteins assessed belonged to the quartile of proteins with the highest abundance and, here, contrary to BALF, Prdx6 displayed the highest levels ( Fig. 1A , right-hand panel). In response to bleomycin, Gpx3 was upregulated also in tissue, albeit to a lesser extent compared to the increase in BALF, while Sod3 was largely unchanged, except during initial acute lung injury ( Fig. 1E ). Furthermore, in contrast to Sod3, tissue Gpx3 was predominantly detected in the insoluble protein fractions, as judged from quantitative detergent solubility profiling (QDSP) generated by Schiller  et al . 35  ( Fig. 1F ). Notably, these insoluble fractions are highly enriched for ECM and matrisome-associated proteins 35 39 .
In mouse lung, Gpx3 is expressed by bronchial epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts and localizes to the ECM
Immunofluorescent stainings showed that, in normal mouse lungs, Gpx3 was mostly secreted by bronchial epithelial cells, where clear vesicular staining was observed ( Fig. 2A , left-hand panels). In addition, we detected localization to the subendothelial and subepithelial basement membrane ( Fig. 2A , left-hand panel, higher magnification insert). Upon development of lung fibrosis following tracheal instillation of bleomycin, Gpx3 expression was observed in many more cells including bronchial epithelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts ( Fig. 2A,B , right-hand panels). Localization to the subendothelial and subepithelial basement membrane was conserved in fibrotic mouse lungs and, additionally, we observed localization to the interstitial ECM as demonstrated by colocalization with extracellular collagen I ( Fig. 2B , right-hand panel, higher magnification insert). Localization of Gpx3 to the interstitial ECM was also evident in more distal areas of fibrotic mouse lung, even if less prominent ( Supplemental Figure S1 ).
High GPX3 levels are found in BALF of some HP and sarcoidosis, but not of IPF and SRIF patients
ELISA-based analysis of GPX3 levels in BALF from ILD patients showed consistently low GPX3 levels in patients with IPF and SRIF, but high levels for some HP and sarcoidosis patients ( Fig. 3A ). In contrast to the animal lung function data ( cf .  Fig. 1D ), there was no correlation of BALF GPX3 levels with forced vital capacity (FVC) ( Fig. 3B ). As gender-specific differences in serum GPX3 and selenoprotein status have been observed 40 41 , we examined the relationship between gender and GPX3 levels in all BALF samples, but found no significant influence of gender on GPX3 levels in this cohort ( Fig. 3C ). Given that GPX3 is a selenoprotein and selenium deficiency has been associated with aging and increased mortality among the elderly 42 43 44 , we also examined a possible correlation between age and GPX3 levels and found that there was no significant correlation ( Fig. 3D ). Finally, smoking status also did not have a significant effect, although, interestingly, GPX3 tended to be decreased in BALF of patients with smoking history ( Fig. 3E ).
GPX3 is upregulated in total tissue lysates from IPF patients
Western Blot analysis and ELISA, using independently derived antibodies, showed upregulation of GPX3 protein levels in total lung lysates from IPF patients, but not from end-stage HP patients, relative to healthy donor control ( Fig. 4 ,  Supplementary Figure S2 ).
In lung tissue sections of HP and IPF patients, GPX3 localizes to ECM structures
Immunofluorescence analysis of human tissue sections supported the colocalization of GPX3 with the bronchial basement membrane in donor, HP and IPF patients, as demonstrated by costaining with extracellular collagen type I ( Fig. 5A , indicated with arrows in the higher magnification inserts). Bronchial epithelial cells and interstitial cells, next to not further characterized immune cells, seem to be major producers of GPX3 in the human lung. Additionally, in contrast to donor tissue, GPX3 clearly also localized to the interstitial matrix in HP and IPF patients ( Fig. 5B , indicated with arrows in the higher magnification inserts).
GPX3 is expressed by primary human bronchial epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts and is variably regulated by TGF-β1, TNF-α, and the oxidative stress inducer menadione
Next, we assessed whether GPX3 was expressed in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (phBECs) and primary human lung fibroblasts (phLFs)  in vitro . For both cell types we observed similar expression of GPX3 on transcript level, comparable to expression of ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX8 (DHX8) used as endogenous control 45  ( Fig. 6 , left-hand panel). GPX3 was also detected in the cell culture supernatant of both cell types ( Fig. 6 , right-hand panel). Here, GPX3 levels were higher in the basolateral cell culture supernatant of phBECs than in cell culture supernatant of phLF.
As we had observed upregulation of GPX3 both during the inflammatory (day 7) and fibrotic (day 14) phase of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis 35 46  ( Fig. 1B,C,E ), upregulation in IPF ( Fig. 4 ), as well as high levels in BALF from ILDs with a strong inflammatory component such as HP and sarcoidosis ( cf .  Fig. 3A ), we investigated whether GPX3 is upregulated by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α or the profibrotic cytokine TGF-β1 in phBEC and phLF. We found consistent downregulation of GPX3 expression by TNF-α in both cell types, both on transcript and on secreted protein level ( Figs 7A  and  8A ). For TGF-β1, we found a weak upregulation in phBEC ( Fig. 7B ), but significant downregulation in phLF ( Fig. 8B ). In contrast, menadione, an inducer of oxidative stress, increased GPX3 expression in phLF, but not in phBEC ( Figs 7C  and  8C , respectively). Efficacy of TNF-α, TGF-β1, and menadione treatment was verified using well-established target genes,  i.e.  interleukin-6 (IL6), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1), and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1), respectively.
