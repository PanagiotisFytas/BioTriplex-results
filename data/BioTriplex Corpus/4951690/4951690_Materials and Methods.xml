Animals
Pathogen-free female C57BL/6 mice (10–12 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River and housed in rooms maintained at constant temperature and humidity with a 12 hours light cycle. Animals were allowed food and water  ad libitum . All animal experiments were conducted under strict governmental and international guidelines and were approved by the local government for the administrative region of Upper Bavaria, Germany.
Induction and measurement of murine pulmonary fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis was induced in female C57BL/6 mice (10–12 weeks old) by a single intratracheal instillation of 50 μl of bleomycin (3 U/kg, Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) dissolved in sterile saline, and applied using the MicroSprayer Aerosolizer, Model IA-1 C (Penn-Century, Wyndmoor, PA). Control mice were instilled with 50 μl of saline. After instillation, mice were kept for 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. Before sacrifice, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine followed by lung function measurement and tissue harvesting as previously described 35 62 . Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained as previously described 35 . Fibrosis was further assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts and histology evaluation.
Proteomic data
Time- and compartment-resolved protein profiles from BALF and lung tissue during bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis were extracted from proteomics data generated previously by us 35 . These data are publicly available in the  supplementary material  of the corresponding open access article 35  or via the MaxQB database ( http://maxqb.biochem.mpg.de/mxdb/  project/show/P013) 63 . Data are always reported as log2 fold changes relative to the median of all control mice from the study (n = 28), if not mentioned otherwise.
Patients
Patients diagnosed with IPF (n = 7), SRIF (n = 3), HP (n = 15), and sarcoidosis (n = 5) were included in the study after signing an informed consent agreement. Patient demographics und lung function data are provided in  Table 1 . The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Thomayer Hospital and the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic and carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. All enrolled patients provided a medical history that included information on smoking and potential exposure to inhaled antigens and underwent a medical examination that involved: a chest X-ray, HRCT of the chest, pulmonary function tests, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). IPF was diagnosed according to the ERS/ATS guidelines 64 . SRIF was diagnosed according to typical radiologic and histopathological findings in combination with a history of smoking, as published by Katzenstein  et al . 3 . Diagnosis of HP was performed as reported previously 65 . Finally, sarcoidosis was diagnosed using the ATS/ERS/WASOG criteria 66 . Notably, this patient cohort included HP and sarcoidosis patients at different disease stages including such with resolving disease.
For immunofluorescence stainings and Western Blot analysis, resected human lung tissue and lung explant material was obtained from the BioArchive CPC-M for lung diseases at the Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC). Here, all HP and IPF samples were lung explant material from transplantations, reflecting non-resolving end-stage disease. All participants gave written informed consent and this part of the study was approved by the local ethics committee of Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Germany (333-10) and carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.
Pulmonary function tests
Forced vital capacity (FVC) was obtained using a ZAN 100 Flowhandy II (Inspire, Oberthulba, Germany). Values are shown as percentage of the predicted value.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
BAL was performed during fiberoptic bronchoscopy under local anaesthesia. The bronchoscope was wedged into a segmental bronchus of the middle lobe. Five fractions of 50 ml of lukewarm saline were instilled and, after each instillation, gently aspirated. Only samples with a recovery > 50% were used (mean recovery per one fraction was 57 ± 20%). The retrieved fluid was placed in a sterile container before division for further investigation. Five millilitres of BALF was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.
Human lung material and isolation and culture of primary human lung fibroblasts
For isolation of primary human lung fibroblasts (phLF), for Western Blot, and for immunofluorescent stainings, resected human lung tissue and lung explant material was obtained from the BioArchive CPC-M for lung diseases at the Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC). HP and IPF patient material was exclusively derived from lung explant material, representing end-stage disease. Primary human lung fibroblasts for  in vitro  experiments were isolated from histologically normal regions adjacent to resected lung tumours. All participants gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the local ethics committee of Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Germany (333-10).
Isolation of phLF from lung tissue was performed as described in detail elsewhere 46 : Briefly, human lung specimens were dissected and digested using 1 mg/ml Collagenase I (Biochrom, Cambridge, UK) at 37 °C for 1 hour. Samples were then passed through nylon filters with a pore size of 70 μm (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), followed by centrifugation at 400 ×  g  and 4 °C for 5 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in DMEM/F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) and plated on 10 cm cell-culture dishes. Medium was changed after 2 days and cells were split after reaching a confluence of 80–90%. For the present study, phLF from four different donors were used in passages 6–8. Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 20% FBS (Pan Biotech) and penicillin/streptomycin.
Culture and differentiation of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (phBEC)
Normal primary human bronchial epithelial cells (phBEC) from three healthy donors were obtained from Lonza (Wokingham, UK), cultured in BEGM medium (Lonza) and differentiated at the air-liquid interface (ALI) in PneumaCult™-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies, Cologne, Germany) for up to 28–33 days as described previously 67 . Briefly, 80.000–90.000 cells (passage 2) were seeded on human placental collagen type IV-coated (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) 12-well transwell inserts (clear, 0.4 μm; Corning; New York, NY, USA) in BEGM medium. Cells were air-lifted upon confluency (=day 0 of ALI culture) by removing the apical medium and substituting the basolateral medium with PneumaCult™-ALI medium containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Medium was changed every other day and cells were washed apically with HBSS (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA, USA) once a week to remove mucus.
Treatment of phLF and phBEC with TGF-β1, TNF-α, and menadione
For treatment of phLF, cells were seeded at a density of approximately 20,000 cells/cm 2 , starved for 24 hours in DMEM/F12 with 0.5% FBS and 100 nM sodium selenite, followed by treatment with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MM, USA), 10 ng/ml TNF-α (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), and 10 μM menadione (Sigma-Aldrich) in starvation medium for the indicated time points.
For treatment of phBEC, fully differentiated cells were stimulated for 24 or 48 hours with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1, 10 ng/ml TNF-α, 10 μM menadione from the apical (in 100 μl HBSS) and basolateral side (in 1 ml ALI medium) simultaneously. Menadione was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); here, control cells were treated using the same volume of DMSO.
RNA isolation and real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis
For RNA extraction, the peqGold RNA isolation kit (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) was used for phLF and the RNeasy Mini Plus Kit (Quiagen; Venlo, Holland) was used for phBEC according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 40 μl reaction using M-MLV reverse transcriptase and random hexamers, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Life Technologies). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany).
Relative transcript abundance of a gene is expressed as −ΔC t  values (−ΔC t  = C t reference  − C t target ) or as fold change derived from the relevant ΔΔC t  values, using 2 −(ΔΔCt) . For specific gene amplification, primers listed in  Table 2  were used. ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX8 (DHX8) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) were used as endogenous controls for standardization of relative mRNA expression in phLF and phBEC, respectively. Normalization with both reference genes provided similar results and, for data presentation, analysis was performed using DHX8 as reference gene. In a previous study 45  we have assessed the quality of a number of reference genes for lung transcriptomes derived from Genevestigator V3 68  and found that DHX8 was a reliable reference gene in this context.
Western Blot analysis for detection of GPX3 in whole lung lysates
Western Blot analysis was performed as described previously 46 . For detection of human GPX3, mouse monoclonal anti-GPX3 antibody (abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab27325) and for detection of β-actin, an HRP-conjugated anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma Aldrich, Louis, MO, USA; A3854) was used.
ELISA for detection of GPX3 in BALF, cell culture supernatant, and tissue homogenates
For detection of human GPX3 in human BALF, cell culture supernatants and tissue homogenates, the GPX3 human ELISA Kit (AdipoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. For phBEC, only the basolateral supernatant was analysed, as no GPX3 was detected in the apical supernatant. For BALF and cell culture supernatants, 100 μl sample were used and the results expressed as a concentration in ng/ml. For tissue homogenates, 5 μg total protein were used and the results normalized to amount of total input protein and expressed as ng GPX3/μg protein.
Measurement of glutathione peroxidase activity in mouse BALF
Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity in mouse BALF was measured by monitoring fluorescence at 460 nm with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm in a Berthold plate reader (Tristar LB941, Bad Wildbad, Germany) 69 . Reactions were performed in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.1% Triton-X-100, 0.40 mM EDTA, 0.20 mM NADPH, 0.25 U glutathione reductase from Baker’s yeast, 1 mM L-glutathione, and 100 μM  t -butyl hydroperoxide (all Sigma-Aldrich) in a total volume of 200 μl. Reactions were started by adding 50 μl mouse BALF. 50 μl phosphate-buffered saline was used as negative and 0.01 U bovine GPX (Sigma Aldrich) as positive control, respectively. Data are reported as activity fold changes relative to the median of control activity for each time point (n = 29).
Immunofluorescent stainings
For staining of tissue sections, human and murine lung tissue was fixed in 4% formalin prior to paraffin embedding. Three-micron sections were prepared and mounted on slides, followed by deparaffinization and immunofluorescent staining according to a standard protocol as follows: For deparaffinization, the paraffin-embedded sections were placed at 60 °C for at least 30 min, incubated twice in xylene (5 minutes each), and then transferred into 100% ethanol (2 minutes), 100% ethanol (2 minutes), 90% ethanol (1 minute), 80% ethanol (1 minute), and 70% ethanol (1 minute) at room temperature. Sections were rinsed in deionized water and stored in 0.5 M Tris, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 6.8 (termed Tris buffer hereafter). For antigen retrieval, slides were immersed in citrate buffer pH 6.0 and heated in a Decloaking Chamber 30 seconds at 125 °C, followed by 10 seconds at 90 °C. Then, the slides were allowed to slowly cool down to room temperature. Slides were washed three times in Tris buffer and primary antibody dilutions were prepared in antibody diluent (Zytomed Systems, Berlin, Germany), added to each tissue section in a wet chamber and incubated overnight. Primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-Gpx3 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, 1:50 or 1:100) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Collagen I antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA, 1:200). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG from Life Technologies (both 1:400). Slides were rinsed three times with Tris buffer and counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:2500) for 1 minute in darkness. Then slides were rinsed three times with Tris buffer, covered with Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and examined under an Axio Imager Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
