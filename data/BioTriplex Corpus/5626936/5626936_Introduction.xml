Neutrophils provide a first-line defense against all types of tissue insult, including invading bacterial pathogens, and sterile tissue injury in both humans and horses. Upon infection, neutrophils move from the vasculature into areas of tissue inflammation by an intricate mechanism of recruitment and activation. This process includes adhesion, crawling, extravasation, interstitial tissue migration, and culminates in the release of bactericidal products such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antibacterial proteins ( 1 ). While these steps are necessary to defend the host against pathogens, dysregulated or overabundant neutrophil responses elicit substantial host tissue injury ( 2 ,  3 ). Indeed, neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many devastating disorders in horses including laminitis ( 4 ,  5 ), heaves ( 6 ,  7 ), and gastrointestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury ( 8 ). Horses diagnosed with these conditions could potentially benefit from therapeutics that prevent or minimize excessive neutrophil activation.
Currently, therapies designed to inhibit neutrophilic inflammation in humans and animals are limited ( 9 ), and novel targets for neutrophil inhibition must be identified. One potential molecular target known to regulate neutrophil functions is cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP is a ubiquitously produced second messenger molecule that is generated intracellularly through neutrophil G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Inflammatory ligands such as cytokines bind to GPCRs and activate intracellular adenylate cyclase (AC), which catalyzes the cyclization of AMP to form cAMP. cAMP regulation is essential for neutrophil functions including adhesion ( 10 ,  11 ), chemotaxis ( 12 ), and production of ROS ( 11 ,  13 ,  14 ).
Naturally occurring cAMP-elevating agents include E-type prostaglandins (PGEs) PGE 1  and PGE 2 . Binding of PGEs to E-prostanoid (EP) 2 and EP4 receptors increases intracellular cAMP and attenuates multiple neutrophil functions  in vitro  ( 15 – 20 ). Unfortunately, clinical use of prostaglandins is limited because they are unstable and have poor oral bioavailability. One PGE analog that is both stable and well absorbed orally is misoprostol ( 21 ). Misoprostol is an EP2, EP3, and EP4 receptor agonist that increases intracellular cAMP and is FDA-approved to treat NSAID-induced ulceration in humans ( 21 – 23 ). In horses, misoprostol has been shown to decrease gastric acid secretion, increase recovery of ischemia-injured equine jejunum, and is currently used to treat NSAID-induced colitis and ulceration ( 24 – 26 ). The anti-inflammatory properties of misoprostol, however, have yet to be studied in equine neutrophils. Therefore, our goal was to evaluate misoprostol as a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic in equine neutrophils. We hypothesized that the PGE 1  analog misoprostol would inhibit proinflammatory functions of stimulated equine neutrophils  in vitro . This study is the first to demonstrate that misoprostol pretreatment attenuates equine neutrophil adhesion, chemotaxis, and ROS production in a concentration-dependent manner.
