Misoprostol Pretreatment Inhibits LTB 4 - but Not PMA- or IC-Induced Equine Neutrophil Adhesion
We hypothesized that the cAMP-elevating agent misoprostol would decrease equine neutrophil adhesion, and that a cell-permeant cAMP analog (db-cAMP) would serve as a model for increased intracellular cAMP and thus a positive control for inhibition of adhesion in our experiments. To examine the effects of misoprostol on varying degrees of β 2  integrin binding, we stimulated equine neutrophil adhesion with the GPCR agonist LTB 4 , the FcγR agonist immune complexes (IC), or a direct PKC agonist phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA).
Our results show that 53.5% of LTB 4 -stimulated neutrophils adhered to FBS-coated plates. Misoprostol pretreatment (300 µM) significantly inhibited LTB 4 -stimulated neutrophil adhesion to 39.8%, and only 22.2% of LTB 4 -stimulated neutrophils pretreated with db-cAMP were adherent in our assay (Figure  1 A). The PKC inhibitor staurosporine significantly attenuated LTB 4 -stimulated neutrophil adhesion to 33.4%, supporting a role for PKC in cytokine induced equine neutrophil adhesion (Figure  1 A). In contrast, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-inhibitor wortmannin had no effect on LTB 4 -stimulated adhesion of equine neutrophils.
Immune complex stimulated 71.3% adhesion of equine neutrophils in our assay. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with misoprostol and db-cAMP had no significant effect on IC-induced adhesion (Figure  1 B). Wortmannin pretreatment significantly inhibited IC-induced adhesion to 12.1%.
PMA stimulated approximately 67.5% of equine neutrophils to become adherent. Our results show that db-cAMP had no significant effect on PMA-mediated neutrophil adhesion; however, misoprostol pretreatment significantly enhanced PMA-induced adhesion to a maximum of 87.5%. Neutrophil pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor staurosporine was utilized as a positive control for inhibition in this assay and significantly inhibited PMA-induced equine neutrophil adhesion to 48.0% (Figure  1 C).
Misoprostol Pretreatment Inhibits Equine Neutrophil Migration toward LTB 4 , CXCL8, and PAF
To our knowledge, there are no previous reports on the effect of the PGE 1  analog misoprostol on the chemotaxis of neutrophils from any species. In this study, we stimulated equine neutrophils to migrate utilizing CXCL8, LTB 4 , and PAF in order to investigate the effects of misoprostol pretreatment on equine neutrophil chemotaxis.
Concentrations of chemoattractants utilized for migration experiments were chosen based on previous work in our lab ( 27 ,  28 ,  30 ). LTB 4  and CXCL8 were the most potent chemoattractants and induced directed migration of 73.6 and 70.8% of equine neutrophils, respectively (Figures  2 A,B). While slightly less potent than LTB 4  and CXCL8, PAF also induced significant neutrophil chemotaxis (58.0%, Figure  2 C). Misoprostol significantly inhibited LTB 4 - and CXCL8-stimulated neutrophil migration at 300 µM (Figures  2 A,B). Misoprostol significantly inhibited PAF-stimulated neutrophil migration at 100 µM (Figure  2 C). Interestingly, db-cAMP significantly inhibited PAF-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis, but had no measured effect on LTB 4 - and CXCL8-induced migration (Figure  2 ).
Neutrophil Production of ROS Is Increased by PMA and Immune Complexes in Unprimed Cells, and by LPS in GM-CSF Primed Cells
We defined the magnitude and kinetics of equine neutrophil ROS production using luminol-enhanced chemiluminesence to establish a reliable assay for the production and detection of equine neutrophil ROS production. Equine neutrophils were stimulated to produce ROS in response to IC, PMA, and LPS.
Equine neutrophils stimulated with 5 µg of immobilized IC produced a robust ROS response that peaked following 60 min of stimulation. This was followed by a decline in ROS production over the subsequent 60 min (Figure  3 A). Because of high horse-to-horse variability, ROS production at this 60-min point was not considered significantly increased over unstimulated cells. However, the next highest point of ROS production at 55 min of IC stimulation was significantly different from controls (Figure  3 A) and was, therefore, selected for subsequent experiments. PMA (100 ng/ml) stimulation resulted in significant ROS production by equine neutrophils at 10 min (Figure  3 B).
Equine neutrophils stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS showed a small increase in ROS production that was not significant compared to controls. Priming cells with 1 ng/ml GM-CSF for 30 min prior to LPS stimulation led to a significant increase in ROS production which peaked following 35 min of LPS treatment. GM-CSF priming alone did not have a significant effect on ROS production (Figure  3 C).
It is worth noting that LPS treatment of primed equine neutrophils resulted in a less potent ROS response than PMA and IC. Peak luminescence values in these cells were one order of magnitude lower than those produced by IC and PMA treatment, indicating that LPS is a weaker stimulant of equine neutrophil ROS production, even following neutrophil priming (Figure  3 ).
Misoprostol Pretreatment Significantly Inhibits IC-and LPS-Induced Equine Neutrophil ROS Production by Equine Neutrophils
We next utilized our validated luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay to evaluate the effect of misoprostol on ROS production by isolated equine peripheral blood neutrophils in response to our three stimulants, IC, PMA and LPS. Misoprostol pretreatment of 200 and 300 µM inhibited IC-stimulated ROS production in a concentration-dependent manner to 49.4 and 42.9% of control, respectively (Figure  4 A). db-cAMP pretreatment also inhibited IC-stimulated ROS production in a concentration-dependent manner at 750 µM and higher (Figure  4 A).
Most concentrations of misoprostol pretreatment actually enhanced PMA-stimulated ROS production of equine neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure  4 B). Unlike the other concentrations tested, 300 µM misoprostol pretreatment significantly inhibited PMA-mediated neutrophil ROS production (Figure  4 B). db-cAMP had no effect on PMA-stimulated ROS production. Based on the db-cAMP treatment results, we suspect the inhibitory effect seen with 300 µM misoprostol might be attributed to cAMP-independent mechanisms. The PKC inhibitor staurosporine was used as a positive control for ROS inhibition (Figure  4 B).
Misoprostol pretreatment significantly inhibited LPS-stimulated ROS production in primed equine neutrophils. This effect was concentration dependent, and was observed even at even the lowest misoprostol concentration. Similarly, db-cAMP pretreatment inhibited ROS production in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure  4 C).
