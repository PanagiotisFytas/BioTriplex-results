Experimental Reagents
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from  E. coli  055:B5, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), CXCL8, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db-cAMP), wortmannin, staurosporine, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and anti-BSA antibody were from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Gemini-Bioproducts (West Sacramento, CA, USA); misoprostol, LTB 4 , and PAF were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA); equine recombinant granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was from Kingfisher Biotech (Saint Paul, MN, USA); and Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) was from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Grand Island, NY, USA).
Equine Donors and Neutrophil Isolation
All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at North Carolina State University (NCSU). Horses included in this study were part of the NCSU Teaching Animal Unit herd, 5–15 years of age, and of mixed breed and gender. All horses were deemed healthy upon physical examination of a board-certified equine internal medicine specialist and were housed under similar conditions and did not receive any medications for the duration of the study.
Neutrophils were isolated from equine whole blood by density-gradient centrifugation as previously described ( 27 ). Briefly, 30–60 cc of heparinized equine whole blood was collected  via  jugular venipuncture. Whole blood was placed into sterile conical tubes for 1 h at room temperature to allow erythrocytes to settle out of suspension. The leukocyte-rich plasma (supernatant) was layered onto Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare, Sweden) at a 2:1 ratio. Cells were centrifuged and erythrocyte contamination was removed from the neutrophil pellet  via  1-min hypotonic lysis.
Misoprostol Pretreatment
Neutrophils were pretreated with indicated concentrations of misoprostol, db-cAMP, wortmannin, staurosporine, or vehicle for each inhibitor, for 30 min at 37°C. Cell viability was evaluated before and after pretreatment using trypan blue exclusion and was routinely >98%.
Neutrophil Adhesion
Equine neutrophil adhesion methods have been optimized in our lab previously ( 27 ). Neutrophils were resuspended to a concentration of 1 × 10 7  cells per ml in HBSS. 2 µg/ml of the fluorescent dye calcein AM (Anaspec, Fremont, CA, USA) was added to cells and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Following calcein AM-labeling, cells were resuspended at 2.0 × 10 6  in HBSS supplemented with 1 mM Ca 2+ , 1 mM Mg 2+ , and 2% FBS. For immune complex (IC)-induced adhesion, Immulon2HB plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with 10 µg BSA overnight at 4°C and then incubated at 37°C for 2 h with 5 µg of anti-BSA antibody. 1 × 10 5  cells were plated per well and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Wells that were not coated with anti-BSA antibodies served as unstimulated controls. For LTB 4 - and PMA-induced adhesion, plates were coated overnight with 5% FBS at 4°C. 1 × 10 5  cells were plated in each well and allowed to rest at 37°C for 10 min before addition of 10 ng/ml PMA (or 1 × 10 −5  % DMSO vehicle) or 10 nM LTB 4  (or 3 × 10 −3  % ethanol vehicle). Cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min with PMA or 75 s with LTB 4 .
Following incubation, fluorescence readings were obtained using an fMax plate reader (485 nm excitation, 530 nm emission) to obtain initial fluorescence, and then again after the second (LTB 4 ) and third (IC and PMA) wash. Percent adhesion was calculated as the difference between the initial and final fluorescence readings in each well. Treatment conditions were performed in triplicate on each plate.
Neutrophil Chemotaxis
Equine neutrophil chemotaxis methods have been optimized in our lab previously ( 27 ,  28 ). Neutrophils were labeled with calcein AM and resuspended in media as described for adhesion experiments. Neuroprobe disposable ChemoTx Systems (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) with 3-µm pore size and polycarbonate track-etch filters were used. Cell media containing chemoattractant or vehicle was added to the bottom chamber of each well. Chemoattractants included 10 nM LTB 4 , 10 nM PAF, 100 ng/ml CXCL8, and vehicle for each chemoattractant (3 × 10 −3  % ethanol for LTB 4  and PAF, HBSS for CXCL8). 100% migration control wells were prepared by adding 1 × 10 4  calcein AM-labeled cells to the bottom chamber of three wells. Porous filters were placed over the bottom chambers so that contact between filter and chemoattractant or control media was established. 1 × 10 4  misoprostol- or control-treated, calcein AM-labeled neutrophils were then added to the top portion of the membrance. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C to allow directed cell migration into the bottom chambers ( 27 ). Following incubation, non-migrated cells were removed from the top of the filters and EDTA was added for 10 min at room temperature to detach cells remaining within the membrane. EDTA was removed and fluorescence of the bottom well was measured using an fMax plate reader as described above. Percent cell migration was determined by percent fluorescence of wells in each treatment group compared to the 100% migration control wells. Treatment conditions were performed in triplicate on each plate.
Neutrophil ROS Production
Production of ROS was measured using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence as previously optimized for equine neutrophils ( 29 ). Cells were plated on sterile, white, 96-well high-binding plates (Sigma), which were coated with 5% FBS (for LPS- and PMA-mediated respiratory burst) or 5 μg/well IC (for IC-mediated respiratory burst) as described above for adhesion experiments. Neutrophils were then stimulated using three different experimental protocols: (1) priming for 30 min with 1 ng/ml GM-CSF, followed by stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS (or PBS vehicle); (2) 100 ng/ml PMA (or 0.01% DMSO vehicle); or (3) 5 µg/well immobilized IC (or no IC unstimulated control). 1 mM luminol was added to each well, and luminesce was measured every 5 min using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL Microplate Fluorometer and Luminometer (Thermo Scientific).
As this assay had not yet been attempted in our lab, preliminary experiments were conducted prior to data collection to determine the optimal number of neutrophils to be used for each stimulant. A standard curve was created by plotting neutrophil cell numbers versus raw luminescence values. From this curve, neutrophil quantities that fell on the linear portion of the curve were selected for analysis (data not shown). In accordance with this preliminary data, neutrophils were resuspended to achieve a final concentration of 3 × 10 5  cells/well (IC), 2 × 10 5  cells per well (LPS), or 1 × 10 5  cells/well (PMA) in HBSS supplemented with 10 µM Ca 2+ , 10 µM Mg 2+ , and 2% FBS.
A series of kinetics studies were completed to determine the time of maximal significant ROS production in response to each stimulant. Based on these results, time points selected were 35 min for LPS, 40 min for PMA, and 55 min for IC. The effect of misoprostol pretreatment on stimulated ROS production was then evaluated at those time points. ROS production in misoprostol-pretreated cells was determined as a percentage of stimulated cells. Treatment conditions were performed in triplicate on each plate for both kinetics and experimental studies.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA). All data were normally distributed (Shapiro–Wilk test) and are presented as mean ± SEM. Significant differences between treatments were determined with One-Way Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (One-Way RM ANOVA) with Holm–Sidak multiple comparisons  post hoc  testing, or two-tailed  t -test, where appropriate. ROS production from one horse was considered a significant outlier  via  the ESD (extreme studentized deviate) method and was excluded from analysis (α = 0.05). A  p -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
