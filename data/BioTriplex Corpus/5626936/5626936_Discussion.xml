The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that the cAMP-elevating agent misoprostol would have anti-inflammatory effects on equine neutrophil functions, including adhesion, chemotaxis, and ROS production. Consistent with our hypothesis, we show that misoprostol pretreatment inhibits LTB 4 -stimulated adhesion (Figure  1 A), LTB 4 -, CXCL8-, and PAF-stimulated migration (Figure  2 ), and LPS-, IC- and PMA-stimulated ROS generation (Figure  4 ) of isolated, primary equine neutrophils. Misoprostol pretreatment had no effect on IC-induced adhesion and actually increased adhesion of neutrophils treated with PMA (Figures  1 B,C). This study brings to light important information about misoprostol, which is a clinically relevant therapeutic that has been widely used to treat horses with colonic ulceration and has more recently been reported to be superior to omeprazole and sucralfate for healing gastric glandular lesions in horses with clinical disease ( 31 ). To our knowledge, we are the first group to establish anti-inflammatory effects of misoprostol on equine neutrophil functions  in vitro . Given the recent report that misoprostol is an excellent therapeutic for healing gastric glandular lesions in horses, our  in vitro  results offer relevant information regarding the anti-inflammatory effects of misoprostol.
The presumed mechanism for misoprostol’s anti-inflammatory effects on neutrophil functions is EP2 and EP4 receptor binding. Activation of these receptors is known to increase intracellular cAMP ( 15 ,  19 ,  21 ). cAMP is a ubiquitously produced second messenger molecule that is generated through GPCR signaling in neutrophils. Ligand binding to GPCRs leads to activation of intracellular AC, which catalyzes the cyclization of AMP to form cAMP. cAMP activates two different intracellular pathways that mediate neutrophil adhesion, protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac) ( 10 ,  11 ). Interestingly, the two pathways activated by cAMP have been shown to induce opposing cell signaling cascades. While PKA signaling in neutrophils is primarily inhibitory, Epac signaling is associated with neutrophil activation ( 32 ). Recently, it has been suggested that PKA is the predominant cAMP pathway within neutrophils, and thus agents that elevate cAMP hold great promise as inhibitors of neutrophil function in inflammatory disease ( 33 ).
Previous reports demonstrate a direct link between elevation of intracellular cAMP and inhibition of equine neutrophil functions. Similarities between the effects of misoprostol and db-cAMP in our system suggest that increased cAMP is the predominant mechanism through which misoprostol inhibits most of the evaluated equine neutrophil functions. However, as we did not measure cAMP levels in response to misoprostol pretreatment, additional studies are needed to determine if there is a direct link between misoprostol, intracellular cAMP, and neutrophil functions.
To enter inflamed tissues, circulating peripheral blood neutrophils must first adhere to endothelial cells neighboring injured tissues. This requires transient chemoattractant-induced adhesion, followed by firmer adhesion of activated neutrophils. Both adhesion events are mediated by β 2  integrins ( 34 ). Increased intracellular cAMP has been shown to inhibit β 2  integrin-dependent adherence of equine neutrophils ( 10 ,  11 ). In this study, pretreatment of equine neutrophils with misoprostol, a cAMP-elevating agent, inhibited LTB 4 - and IC-induced adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner. However, in contrast to previous studies in our lab ( 11 ), inhibition only achieved statistical significance in LTB 4  but not IC-stimulated cells (Figures  1 A,B). We hypothesize that divergent signaling pathways induced by these endogenous stimulants lead to differing effects of misoprostol on transient (LTB 4 ), versus firm (IC), neutrophil adhesion. In human neutrophils, LTB 4 -mediated GPCR-stimulated adhesion is PI3K-independent, while IC-mediated FcγR-stimulated adhesion is PI3K dependent ( 35 ). These findings are supported in this study in equine neutrophils (Figures  1 A,B). Differences in PI3K dependence, as well as additional downstream signaling molecules, could explain the weaker inhibitory effects of misoprostol on IC- versus LTB 4 -stimulated equine neutrophil adhesion.
In contrast to LTB 4  and IC, misoprostol pretreatment led to a dose-dependent increase in PMA-stimulated adhesion that is similar to previous reports from our lab ( 11 ). PMA is a synthetic mimic of diacylglycerol and permeates the cell to directly activate PKC. Because PMA bypasses cell surface receptor activation it is a non-physiologic stimulus of neutrophil adhesion ( 1 ). From this experiment, we conclude that misoprostol inhibits equine neutrophil adhesion responses through a mechanism that is upstream of PKC-activation.
Following adhesion to the vascular endothelium, neutrophils must crawl along the vascular endothelium and undergo directed interstitial tissue migration in response to chemoattractant gradients to reach sites of tissue injury or infection ( 36 ,  37 ). Chemoattractants induce neutrophil migration by engaging GPCRs and activating many downstream signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, phospholipase C, and PI3K. While many of these mechanisms are shared, each unique GPCR initiates different chemotactic responses, intensities, and migration patterns ( 38 ). Lipid chemoattractants (such as LTB 4  and PAF)  initiate  neutrophil chemotaxis into inflamed tissues, while chemokines such as CXCL8 act at  later  stages to amplify neutrophil chemotaxis ( 39 ). Because of these differences, we evaluated the effect of misoprostol on multiple types of chemoattractants including the lipids LTB 4  and PAF, and the chemokine CXCL8.
Human neutrophil migration is enhanced by 1 µM PGE 1  pretreatment in response to fMLP, but is inhibited at higher PGE 1  concentrations ( 40 ). In this study, misoprostol pretreatment inhibited equine neutrophil chemotaxis toward CXCL8, LTB 4 , and PAF (Figure  2 ). Misoprostol most potently inhibited chemotaxis toward PAF, which was the weakest chemoattractant evaluated (Figure  2 C). With the more potent chemoattractants (LTB 4  and CXCL8), 300 µM concentration of misoprostol was significantly inhibitory. Interestingly, 1–10 µM misoprostol showed a trend toward enhancing LTB 4 - and CXCL8-directed migration, but this was not statistically significant (Figures  2 A,B). These data are consistent with previous reports that low versus high levels of cAMP can stimulate or inhibit neutrophil migration, respectively ( 41 ). Previous studies have demonstrated that endogenous PGEs inhibit cell migration through an EP2 receptor mediated increase in intracellular cAMP ( 12 ,  15 ,  21 ). Additionally, cAMP’s effect on neutrophil chemotaxis varies depending on the concentration of the chemoattractant. For example, increased intracellular cAMP in the presence of optimal concentrations of LTB 4  has little effect on neutrophil migration; but the same levels of intracellular cAMP significantly inhibit neutrophil migration toward threshold concentrations of LTB 4  (defined as the lowest concentrations of LTB 4  that elicit a significant chemotactic response) ( 12 ). Taken together with our findings, it is likely that the effects of cAMP on equine neutrophil chemotaxis are dependent on the specific cAMP-elevating agent and the chemoattractant concentration utilized.
Once within tissues, neutrophils are designed to produce ROS such as such as superoxide  ( O 2 − )  and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to kill bacterial pathogens. Neutrophils are capable of releasing ROS intracellularly within phagosomes containing engulfed microbes, as well as into the surrounding tissues to kill nearby pathogens. Release of ROS into surrounding tissues can significantly contribute to host tissue damage in many disease states; in patients with inflammatory, rather than infectious diseases, overabundant ROS production can cause substantial tissue injury. Equine patients with inflammatory diseases would benefit from therapies that restrict neutrophil ROS production. Misoprostol and other cAMP-elevating agents are known to inhibit human neutrophil ROS production ( 19 ,  42 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that misoprostol would inhibit ROS production by LPS-stimulated equine neutrophils. To detect both intra- and extra-cellular neutrophil ROS production, both of which can contribute to host tissue damage, we utilized luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence methods ( 43 ).
Because LPS alone induced minimal ROS production in equine neutrophils, we hypothesized that priming neutrophils with granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) would enhance LPS stimulation. This hypothesis was based on previous studies which showed that neutrophil priming with GM-CSF prior to stimulation led to more robust ROS generation ( 44 ). Consistent with this report, we show that GM-CSF-primed, LPS-stimulated equine neutrophils generate significantly higher levels of ROS compared to LPS-stimulated cells that have not been primed (Figure  3 C).
Misoprostol and db-cAMP inhibited IC and LPS-stimulated ROS production in a concentration-dependent manner in our study (Figures  4 A,C). IC- and LPS-stimulated ROS production is dependent on PI3K activation and is inhibited by PKA ( 45 ,  46 ). Together, these data suggest that misoprostol likely inhibits ROS production in IC and LPS-stimulated neutrophils through cAMP-activated PKA. In contrast, PMA stimulates ROS production through direct activation of PKC ( 47 ,  48 ). Therefore, this pathway is generally thought to be insensitive to cAMP-elevating agents ( 42 ,  45 ). Interestingly, while db-cAMP had no effect on PMA-mediated ROS production, 100 µM misoprostol significantly increased ROS levels. Conversely, 300 µM misoprostol significantly decreased ROS production (Figure  4 B), which is consistent with previously published findings ( 49 ). Insensitivity of PMA-induced ROS generation to cAMP helps to explain these contradictory findings.
Misoprostol is currently used to treat and prevent NSAID-induced GI injury in equine patients suffering from inflammatory disease ( 23 ,  24 ). While select non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug have been shown to inhibit neutrophil adhesion ( 50 ), chemotaxis ( 51 ), and respiratory burst ( 52 ), previous reports suggest these effects are further augmented by misoprostol ( 53 ,  54 ). Previous research has also shown that misoprostol restores mucosal barrier function following ischemia-reperfusion injury in equine small intestine, potentially through a cAMP-dependent mechanism ( 26 ,  55 ). Therefore, the addition of misoprostol to NSAID therapy could lead to more complete inhibition of neutrophilic inflammation with fewer GI side effects compared to NSAID treatment alone. Based on these previous reports and our current data, we propose that combining misoprostol with NSAID therapy in horses could help maintain GI health and could potentially inhibit neutrophil inflammatory functions.
This study demonstrates for the first time that misoprostol exerts anti-inflammatory effects on equine neutrophil effector functions  in vitro . While it is true that relatively high concentrations of misoprostol were necessary for significant inhibition of neutrophil function  in vitro , this does not preclude our data from being clinically relevant. We propose that orally administered misoprostol may produce local, cAMP-mediated, anti-inflammatory effects on injured GI mucosa. While these data are promising, high doses of misoprostol have been associated with negative side effect in human, canine, and equine patients, which include abdominal discomfort and diarrhea ( 56 ,  57 ). Additional studies utilizing e x- and in vivo  equine inflammatory models are currently underway to investigate this hypothesis and assess the safety profile of this drug in relation to potential anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, these data provide proof of principle that misoprostol, a known EP receptor agonist, elicits anti-inflammatory effects on equine neutrophils. Based on this finding, we are currently conducting additional studies to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of specific EP2 and/or EP4 receptor agonists on equine leukocytes.
