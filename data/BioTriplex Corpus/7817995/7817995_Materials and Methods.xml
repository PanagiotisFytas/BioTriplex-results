Cell Culture
Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were harvested from heterozygous breedings of  Suox ±  mice (Kohl et al., unpublished) as described previously ( Xu, 2005 ). In brief, embryos were removed at E13.5 after timed matings and dissected from the uterus. Fetuses were then minced into fine pieces and incubated in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 4°C overnight. On the next day, the suspension was heated for 30 min in a 37°C water bath. The digested tissue was then further broken down into a cell suspension by vigorous pipetting in culture medium. MEF cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Pan Biotech), supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Gibco by Life Technologies) and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Pan Biotech; Origin: South Africa). For galactose treatment, cells were cultured in glucose-free DMEM (Pan Biotech, P04-01548S1) supplemented with 10 mM galactose or equal amounts of glucose as control.
Human fibroblasts were extracted from juvenile foreskin. Control fibroblasts were purchased from PromoCell (C-12300). Patient fibroblasts were kindly provided by J. Reiss (Institute for Human Genetics, University of Göttingen, Germany).  GPHN  deficient fibroblasts were first described in  Reiss et al. (2001) .  MOCS1 -deficient fibroblast were part of an earlier study ( Reiss and Hahnewald, 2011 ).  MOCS2  deficient fibroblasts were characterized in  Hahnewald et al. (2006) . Fibroblasts were kept in RPMI 1640 medium (Pan Biotech) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Gibco by Life Technologies) and 10% FBS (Pan Biotech; Origin: South Africa). All cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 .
Mouse Keeping
All animals were kept and bred in accordance with European, national and institutional guidelines and protocols were approved by local government authorities (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany; reference 84-02.04.2014.A372). Mice were kept under a 12 h light cycle and provided with regular chow diet and water  ad libitum . For the generation of homozygous  Suox –/–  mice, heterozygous mice of at least 2 months of age were kept in 1:1 (male:female) breedings.
Mitochondrial Morphology Analysis
Mitochondrial morphology in MEF cells and patient fibroblasts was visualized using MitoTracker TM  Red CMXRos (Invitrogen, United States). The cells were seeded onto sterile cover slips the day prior to the experiment. Cells were incubated in 200 nM MitoTracker TM  Red CMXRos diluted in fresh DMEM for 30 min at 37°C. For SO 3 2–  treatments, the respective SO 3 2–  concentration was added to the medium 30 min prior to the MitoTracker and incubated at 37°C. Afterward, the cells were washed carefully with PBS before fixation in 4% PFA for 15 min at 4°C. Remaining PFA was removed by three washing steps with PBS (3 × 5 min). Finally, cover slips were mounted on slides with Mowiol/DABCO (Carl Roth). Images were acquired using a Nikon A1 confocal laser scanning microscope. Images were processed using ImageJ software.
Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed as described previously with minor modifications ( Verburg and Hollenbeck, 2008 ). In short, a 5 μM stock of tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM, Invitrogen) in DMSO was diluted into DMEM medium to a final concentration of 20 nM. Cells were incubated in 20 nM TMRM for 20 min at 37°C. As a control, cells were co-stained with 200 nM MitoTracker TM  Deep Red (which accumulates in mitochondria independent of their membrane potential) for 20 min at 37°C. Images were acquired with a Nikon A1R confocal microscope. Pixel intensity for the TMRM was subsequently quantified using ImageJ (ImageJ,  RRID:SCR_003070 ) and normalized by the respective intensity of the MitoTracker TM  Deep Red staining.
Mitochondrial Motility and Content
The day prior to the experiment, cells were seeded onto a Nunc TM  glass-bottom dish (Thermo Scientific, United States). Mitochondria were visualized via incubation with 200 nM MitoTracker TM  Deep Red (diluted in DMEM) for 20 min at 37°C. Mitochondrial motility was analyzed via life cell imaging using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with environmental chamber. Time-lapse videos were taken over 5 min at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Mitochondrial motility and content were quantified after creating binary images with the software ImageJ (ImageJ,  RRID:SCR_003070 ) as described in  Koopman et al. (2006) . In brief, maximum intensity projections of image stacks were converted to 8-bit formats and then subjected to a white top-hat filter (MorphoLibJ plugin) before a final thresholding step. Finally, the amount of moved pixels of selected mitochondria between the first and last timepoint (always 5 min apart) were assessed using the XOR function of the Image Calculator.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
For Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), MEF cells were cultured on aclar foil and fixed with pre-warmed fixative solution (2% glutaraldehyde, 2.5% sucrose, 3 mM CaCl 2 , 100 Mm HEPES, pH 7.3) at RT for 30 min and 4°C for another 30 min. Afterward, fixed cells were washed with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, incubated with 1% OsO 4 , 1.25% Sucrose, 10 mg/ml Potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1 M Cacodylate buffer for 1 h on ice, and washed three times with 0.1 M Cacodylate buffer. Subsequently, cells were dehydrated using ascending ethanol series (50, 70, 90, 3 × 100) for 7 min each at 4°C. After that, cells were incubated with ascending EPON series at 4°C: EPON with ethanol (1 + 1) for 1 h, EPON with ethanol (3 + 1) for 2 h, EPON alone ON, 2 × 2 h with fresh EPON at RT and finally embedded for 48–72 h at 62°C. Ultrathin sections of 70 nm were cut with a diamond knife using an ultramicrotome (Leica, UC7) and stained with uranyl acetate for 15 min at 37°C and lead nitrate solution for 4 min. Electron micrographs were taken with a JEM-2100 Plus Electron Microscope (JEOL). Camera OneView 4K 16 bit (Gatan), and software DigitalMicrograph (Gatan).
ATP Measurement
Intracellular ATP levels in MEF cells were quantified using the CellTiter-Glo ®  Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, United States). In short, 8 × 10 4  cells per well were seeded in 6-well plates the day prior to the experiment. The cells were incubated in glucose- or galactose containing medium for 1 h. They were then lysed in 150 μl RIPA buffer (Sigma). After centrifugation for 20 min at 4°C and 13,000  g , 50 μl of the lysate was added to 50 μl CellTiter-Glo ®  Reagent in a 96-well. The plate was placed on an orbital shaker for 2 min to mix the contents before a 10 min incubation at room temperature. Luminescence was recorded using an EnVision Multimode Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, United States). ATP levels were quantified by comparison to a standard curve and normalized to the protein concentration in the respective sample.
Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability after incubation in glucose- or galactose containing medium was assessed by the MTT assay as described previously ( Kumar et al., 2017 ). In brief, 1 × 10 4  cells/well were seeded onto a 96-well and grown for 24 h. The next day, the medium was exchanged for DMEM containing either 10 mM glucose or galactose as a carbon source. After 24 h, the old medium was exchanged with fresh phenol red- free DMEM containing 100 μM (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphyenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT). After a 4 h incubation at 37°C in the dark, the MTT solution was exchanged for 100% DMSO. The plate was then placed in a shaker for 10–30 min at 37°C until all cells were solubilized. Finally, the absorption was measured at 570 nm (reference 650 nm) in well plate reader (Tecan Spark).
Determination of Protein Concentration
The concentration of proteins from cell extracts was determined by means of the Bradford assay. Therefore, 190 μl diluted Bradford solution (1/5 dilution) was incubated with 10 μl of protein solution (respective dilution) for 20 min and the absorption change at 595 nm was measured using a well plate reader (BioTek, Germany). The determined absorption change was then compared to that of standard proteins with known concentration in order to determine the protein concentration of unknown solutions.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blotting was performed on crude protein extracts from MEF cells lysed in 100 mM Tris/Ac, pH 8.0. Protein concentration was adjusted accordingly after determination with the Bradford assay. Unless otherwise indicated, 30 μg of protein lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using a standard semi-dry blotting protocol onto PVDF membranes. SO protein levels were visualized using a monoclonal anti-SUOX antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# WH0006821M1,  RRID:AB_1843810 ) in conjunction with a HRP-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, United States Cat# sc-2055,  RRID:AB_631738 ). Vinculin was detected as loading control using a polyclonal anti-vinculin (H-300) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, United States Cat# sc-5573,  RRID:AB_2214507 ) together with a HRP-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, United States Cat# sc-2054,  RRID:AB_631748 ). Signals were detected using chemiluminescent substrates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States, #34580) and a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS + system.
