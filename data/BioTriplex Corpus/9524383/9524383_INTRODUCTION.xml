Calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT) is a rare benign mesenchymal neoplasm. The etiology and pathogenesis of this tumor are uncertain. It was first described in 1988 by Rosenthal and Abdul-Karim 1  and was termed childhood fibrous tumor with psammoma bodies. The World Health Organization (WHO) established the name “Calcifying Fibrous Tumors” for this lesion in 2002. 2  CFT affects patients in a wide age range and has a wide anatomic distribution. In a review of 157 cases, a slight female predominance (56%) was noticed, with a mean age of 33.5 years (range 5 weeks to 84 years). 3  Anatomical distribution includes soft tissues, neck, gastrointestinal tract, mesentery, peritoneum, mediastinum, and adrenal gland. Within the gastrointestinal tract, the tumor is frequently submucosal, and the most common sites are the stomach and small intestine. 4  Herein we describe a case of calcifying fibrous tumor of the small bowel.
