The renin-angiotensin system is a major endocrine/paracrine system that regulates blood pressure (BP) in our body [ 49 ], genes encoding components of this system have been strong candidates for the investigation of the genetic basis of essential hypertension and major targets for antihypertensive drugs [ 50 ]. However, previous studies in south India mainly focus on limited gene of RAS [ 47 ,  48 ,  51 ]; thus we carried out a case-control study to systemically investigate the association between polymorphisms in RAS genes and essential hypertension. The present study identifies gender specific genetic variants in RAS genes that may play crucial roles in BP regulation and susceptibility for hypertension. A significantly higher frequency of the  AGT  235TT was observed in female patients when compared to the female controls.  ACE  DD was more prevalent in male patients when compared with male controls. So,  AGT  M235T was associated with EHT in females and  ACE  I/D was associated with males in our study population. Association of T variant with the essential hypertension in our study has shown agreement with some studies.
Jeunemaitre et al., 1992 [ 4 ], were the first to report the linkage of the molecular variants M235T with hypertension in the Caucasians. Subsequent studies among the UK/Chinese/Malaysian/south Indian supported the former finding [ 15 ,  40 ,  47 ,  48 ,  52 ] while a study of Germany/North India is inconsistent with the previous report  [ 47 ,  53 ]. The association studies in the Africans/African-Americans mostly found a negative association [ 54 ,  55 ], but the high frequency of T allele was observed in this population and it is associated with increase in plasma and mRNA  AGT  concentration [ 11 ,  55 ,  56 ].
The frequency of the 235T variant (major allele in our study) was 0.746 for this study among cases and this frequency was similar to study already reported in Chinese (0.73) and Hong Kong Chinese (0.82) population [ 16 ,  57 ]. The frequency of 235T variant in the 1000 genome project was found to be 0.87 in Africans, 0.64 in Americans, and 0.84 in Asians but the frequency was deviated in Europeans with the frequency of 0.41 [ 58 ]. Several studies in south India has reported that the 235T frequencies are in the range of 0.56–0.81 in the patients [ 13 ,  59 – 61 ]. But in north India the frequency was reported to be 0.31 in the cases [ 44 ]. Prasad and colleague have performed a comparative study of north and south India in control subjects and 235T variant frequency was found to be 0.33 and 0.52, respectively [ 62 ]. These overall results show that 235T variant is predominantly present in south India compared to north India. Our study showed a higher OR 2.62 (95% CI, 1.24–5.76;  P  = 0.006) compared to a recent meta-analysis [ 15 ] in Han Chinese population which reports high association between  AGT  M235T polymorphism and hypertension (OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.16–2.03;  P  = 0.002). On the contrary, another meta-analysis of 126 studies by Sethi et al. (2003) has reported that odds ratio for hypertension was 1.19 (1.10 to 1.30) in TT individuals in white subjects and 1.60 (1.19 to 2.15) in Asian subjects and it was not associated with SBP or DBP [ 63 ]. Instead, M235T genotype was associated with a stepwise increase in angiotensinogen levels in white subjects and a corresponding increase in risk of hypertension in both White and Asian subjects [ 63 ]. In another meta-analysis, the frequencies of the AGT T allele were 80% in cases and 72% in controls. The pooled OR (with 95% CI) of TT versusMT + MM was 1.76 (1.44–2.16) ( P  < 0.00001) with T versus M of 1.54 (1.31–1.81). The pooled OR of MM versus MT + TT was 0.67 (0.45–1.00) ( P  = 0.05) [ 16 ].
In this study, the significantly higher prevalence of 235T allele in female patients is in agreement with the previous report that the T allele was significantly more prevalent among female ETH than in control subjects [ 4 ]. In contrast, Freire et al. (1998) [ 64 ] found that the  AGT  M235T homozygous mutation genotype was significantly higher in males compared to females. Earlier studies have found that plasma  AGT  levels in postmenopausal women are slightly higher [ 65 ] than in men [ 66 ]. Plasma angiotensinogen levels are more increased in M235T variant than the 235 M variant with administration of ethinyl estradiol (EE), a synthetic estrogen. The  AGT  G (-6) variant is less transcriptionally active with lower levels of  AGT  mRNA [ 16 ,  67 ] and a significant linkage disequilibrium between M235T and G-6A was also reported. These findings reveals that G-6A polymorphism, which is linked to nonfunctioning M235T, increased the plasma  AGT  level via regulation of  AGT  gene transcription and was involved in the pathogenesis of the predisposition to hypertension. Thus, sex hormones such as estrogen might bind to the core promoter region and enhance the transcription of  AGT  gene. However, it is also can be hypothesized that estrogen may bind to the -6A variant more effectively and  AGT  gene expression could be more in this variant. Hence, the angiotensinogen promoter is directly controlled by estrogen [ 68 ,  69 ].
The I/D allelic variant (intronic deletion of a 287 bp Alu sequence repetitive element, D allele) is one of the most intensively investigated genetic polymorphism in the field of hypertension and cardiovascular disease research [ 70 ,  71 ]. In the present study, dominant model of  ACE  gene in male (II + ID versus DD) is associated with EHT in south Indian and it was also observed that I allele has a protective role. Overrepresentation of D allele in male cases represents strong association in pathogenesis of hypertension in male. This is in accordance with the previous report by many studies [ 72 – 74 ]. Our study showed a lower OR 0.401 (95% CI 0.224–0.718;  P  < 0.01) compared to a recent meta-analysis [ 22 ] in whole Chinese population which reports high association with  ACE  DD polymorphism with hypertension (OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.17–1.46;  P  < 0.01). The D allele of  ACE  was initially suggested to be associated with increased levels of serum  ACE  activity as compared with I variant [ 75 ,  76 ]. In contrast to this, Zee et al. (1992) has reported that “I” allele was associated with high blood pressure in an Australian population with strong evidence of familial hypertension [ 77 ]. In recent meta-analysis, the distribution of the D allele frequency was 0.45 for the EH group and 0.40 for the control group. The summary OR for the distribution frequency of D allele was 1.27 (5% CI 1.17–1.37). The heterogeneity among the 67 studies was also significant ( P  < 0.00001,  I (2) = 71.4%). There was a significant association between distribution frequency of the D allele and EH risk in Han, Kazakh, Tibetan, Zhuang, and unclassified nationalities ( P  < 0.05). Contradictory result was observed in the national minorities, such as Mongolian, Uighur, Yi, Dongxiang, Yugu, Korean and Gamel, and the  D  allele; and EH risk was not significant ( P  > 0.05) [ 22 ].
The mechanism of the sex specific association with hypertension remains unclear. One notion is that estrogen protects against hypertension. Even though estrogen upregulates the  AGT  gene expression but it again acts as negative feedback mechanism in controlling renin secretion and then the  ACE  secretion in RAS [ 78 ]. Sex differences exist in the regulation of arterial pressure and renal function by RAS. This may in part stem from a differential balance in the pressor and depressor arms of the RAS (Hilliard et al., 2013). In males, the  ACE /AngII/ AGTR1  pathways are enhanced, whereas, in females, the balance is shifted towards the  ACE2 /Ang(1-7)/MasR (Mas receptor) and angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT 2 R) pathways [ 79 ]. Studies reported that premenopausal women, as compared to age matched men, are protected from renal and cardiovascular disease, and this differential balance of the RAS between the sexes likely contributes [ 80 ,  81 ].
There were some limitations in this study. First, the age and sex match case control was not available in the sample studied. Our approach is based on a sample with a relatively homogeneous genetic background, and therefore the results are unlikely to be affected by unmeasured confounding factors of population stratification. This study did not measure central obesity and psychiatric comorbidities, the major risk factor for hypertension. There are no measurements of plasma angiotensinogen levels or other markers of RAS activation available to correlate directly with the genetic polymorphisms investigated in this study.
