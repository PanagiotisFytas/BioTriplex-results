The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Roche) and immunofluorescence images were captured under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus).
In vivo tumor formation assay
Four-week-old female BALB/C athymic nude mice used for animal experiment were obtained commercially from National Laboratory Animal Center (Beijing, China). All experimental and animal care procedures were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of Central Hospital of Zibo. Totally, 2 × 10 6  SW1990 cell lines transfected with sh-NC, sh-LINC01232, or sh-LINC01232 + TM9SF2 were collected. The treated cells were subcutaneously injected into the left flank of the nude mice. Tumor volume was calculated as 0.5 × length × width 2  every fourth day. Four weeks later, mice were killed. Cancerous tissues were excised and weighed for further study.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 22.0 and all results of experiments were displayed as mean ± SD. Student’s  t  test was adopted for analysis of differences between two groups. Comparisons among three or more groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA.  P  value threshold was set as 0.05 to be statistically significant.
