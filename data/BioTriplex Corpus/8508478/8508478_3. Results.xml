In this study, the median PRAL and NEAP score were 4.1 mEq/day and 42.4 mEq/day, respectively. Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were presented according to the quartiles of the PRAL score. Age, sex, educational level, smoking status, drinking status, and physical activity significantly differed according to the quartiles of the PRAL (all  p  < 0.0001). The individuals in the highest quartile of the PRAL were significantly younger, more likely to be men, had higher than college-level education, were current smokers and drinkers, and were not involved in physical activity as compared to those in the lowest quartile ( Table 1 ).
  shows the nutrient intake, food group consumption, and biochemical data according to the quartiles of the PRAL. The energy intake, percentage of energy from carbohydrate, fat, total protein, plant protein, and animal protein, and consumption of dietary fiber, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, and magnesium significantly differed according to the quartiles of the PRAL (all  p  < 0.05). The intake of total energy and percentage of energy from fat, total protein, and animal protein were the highest among those in the highest quartile of the PRAL. Meanwhile, the percentage of energy from carbohydrate and plant protein and consumption of dietary fiber, potassium, and calcium were the highest among those in the lowest quartile of the PRAL. The consumption of vegetables, fruits, meat, fish and shellfish, and milk and dairy products significantly differed according to the quartiles of the PRAL (all  p  < 0.05) ( Table 2 ). The intake of meat, fish, and shellfish was the highest among those in the highest quartile of the PRAL, whereas the intake of vegetables, fruits, and milk and dairy products was the lowest among those in the highest quartile of the PRAL. The triglyceride and total cholesterol levels significantly differed according to the quartiles of the PRAL (all  p  < 0.05); high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level did not differ ( p  = 0.49).
During a mean follow-up of 5.0 years (223,552 person years), 2500 new cases of hyperuricemia were reported. The relationship between the quartiles of the energy-adjusted PRAL and NEAP scores and the incidence of hyperuricemia is presented in  Table 3 . Those in the highest quartile of the PRAL had a 27% higher risk of hyperuricemia than those in the lowest quartile, after controlling for sex and age (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.14–1.43,  p  for trend <0.0001). Similar findings were found for the NEAP score (HR for the fourth vs. first quartile: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.11–1.39,  p  for trend <0.0001). The associations between dietary acid load and hyperuricemia were slightly weaker in the models when the educational level, smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, BMI, and examination site were additionally adjusted for. Those in the highest quartiles of the PRAL and NEAP scores had 21% (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07–1.35,  p  for trend <0.0001) and 17% (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.04–1.31,  p  for trend <0.0001) higher risks for hyperuricemia than those in the lowest quartiles, respectively. An increase of 1 SD in the PRAL was associated with a 2% (HR per SD: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.03) increase in the incidence of hyperuricemia; however, no significant increase was observed with an increase of 1 SD in the NEAP score (HR per SD: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.96–1.31) after controlling for the covariates.
The food group consumption and risk of hyperuricemia are presented in  Table 4 . In the fully adjusted model, those in the highest tertile for the consumption of grains and grain products, rice, and vegetables had a 12%, 15%, and 10% decrease in the incidence of hyperuricemia compared to than those in the lowest tertile, respectively (HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80–0.97; HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.77–0.94; HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.81–0.99, respectively). The intake of rice, fruits, meat and meat products, and fish and shellfish did not show significant associations with the incidence of hyperuricemia. We further assessed the relationship between serum uric acid levels and alcohol consumption, especially beer and wine ( Table 5 ). We observed that beer intake was positively associated with serum uric acid levels ( p  < 0.0001), while wine intake was not significantly associated with serum uric acid levels ( p  = 0.99).
