In this prospective cohort study, dietary acid load evaluated using the PRAL and NEAP scores was found to be positively associated with the future risk of hyperuricemia in middle-aged and older Korean adults. This association was shown in various models: models unadjusted and adjusted for sex and age and models further adjusted for educational level, smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, BMI, and examination site. Our findings on the association between the PRAL and NEAP scores and the incidence of hyperuricemia are in agreement with previous findings [ 10 , 16 ]. Consuming a highly alkaline diet by increasing fruits and vegetables was associated with increased renal uric acid excretion and decreased serum uric acid levels. Although the underlying mechanisms between the dietary acid load and incidence of hyperuricemia are not fully understood, it has been suggested that uric acid excretion is more favorable in alkaline urine pH than in acidic urine pH [ 16 ]. Thus, alkaline urine pH from eating highly alkalizing foods is effective for removing uric acid from the body [ 34 ].
We further assessed the relationship between food group intake and the incidence of hyperuricemia. A high intake of grains and grain products, vegetables, and milk and dairy products was inversely associated with the risk of hyperuricemia. In agreement with our findings, a cross-sectional study targeting individuals with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome from the PREDIMED-Plus cohort reported that hyperuricemia was negatively associated with a high consumption of dairy products [ 35 ]. Moreover, in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a high DASH dietary pattern score, characterized by a high consumption of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, was associated with a low risk of gout, indicating that it is effective in reducing uric acid levels in individuals with hyperuricemia [ 36 ]. Furthermore, the Nutrition and Health Surveys in Taiwan showed that consumption of vegetables, such as carrots and mushrooms, was inversely associated with the incidence of hyperuricemia [ 37 ]. The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey also reported that those who consumed >2 servings of total dairy foods had significantly lower levels of serum uric acid than those who consumed <0.5 servings [ 13 ]. Lactose and galactose are prudent in dairy products, which can trigger the urate transporter/channel and consequently decrease the uric acid level in the plasma [ 38 ]. Interestingly, in our study, no significant difference was found between the consumption of fish and shellfish and the risk of hyperuricemia. In contrast, the consumption of seafood was associated with a high prevalence of hyperuricemia in the Chinese population [ 39 , 40 ]. These variations may be attributed to the different levels of purine content in seafood owing to the different cooking methods and preparations, and the fact that they metabolize differently and produce different alterations in uric acid metabolism [ 15 , 41 , 42 ].
In this study, beer and wine intake were separately analyzed in relation to serum uric acid levels. Although serum uric acid levels increased with beer intake, wine intake did not increase with serum uric acid levels. These findings were consistent with those of previous findings [ 43 , 44 ]. It has been suggested that beer has high purine contents; hence, purines ingested from beer may increase serum uric acid concentration [ 44 ]. In contrast, wine has a low amount of purines, and non-alcoholic components such as antioxidants may alleviate the effect of alcohol on the serum uric acid levels [ 44 ].
High PRAL and NEAP scores have been associated with hyperuricemia and other adverse outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 22 ], renal stone formation [ 45 ], frailty [ 46 ], and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults [ 47 ]. In a large prospective study, a highly acidic diet in women (PRAL of ≥7 mEq/day and NEAP score of ≥51.3 mEq/day) was associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes compared to an alkaline diet (HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.29–1.90 for the PRAL score; HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.30–1.89 for the NEAP score) in a fully adjusted model [ 22 ]. A high PRAL score was associated with an increased risk of renal stone formation, especially in those with a low consumption of vegetables [ 45 ]. In elderly Japanese women, the positive association between PRAL and NEAP scores and frailty may be partly attributed to the foods and nutrients that are components for calculating these scores [ 46 ]. Specifically, the consumption of fruits, vegetables, proteins, and minerals was inversely associated with frailty [ 46 ]. Both excess alkalinity and acidity in the diet were associated with a high mortality risk specifically related to cardiovascular disease-related causes [ 47 ]. The authors suggested that a diet low in magnesium, potassium, and fiber may induce acidosis, thus yielding nutritional requirements [ 47 , 48 ].
The strength of our study is the prospective cohort study design, with detailed information on dietary and lifestyle factors; thus, we were able to adjust for numerous covariates in our models. We also used validated measures, such as the PRAL and NEAP scores, to estimate the potential acid load of overall diets [ 17 ]. A limitation of our study is that the dietary assessment was conducted through self-reported methods, which are prone to causing random and systematic measurement errors [ 46 ]. To reduce these errors, we obtained the energy-adjusted PRAL and NEAP score using energy-residual methods [ 29 ]. Further, genetic factors were not considered in this study. Three urate transporters, URAT1/SLC22A12 [ 49 ], GLUT9/SLC2A9 [ 50 ], and ABCG2/BCRP [ 51 ], have been identified playing crucial roles in regulating the levels of serum uric acid. Common defects of the ABCG2 exporter have been identified to cause elevated serum uric acid and gout [ 52 , 53 , 54 ].  ABCG2  variants have been shown to have stronger effects on the risk of hyperuricemia than major environmental risk factors such as aging, obesity, and heavy drinking [ 55 ]. Future studies are warranted to elucidate the relationship between  ABCG2  polymorphisms, dietary factors, and hyperuricemia.
