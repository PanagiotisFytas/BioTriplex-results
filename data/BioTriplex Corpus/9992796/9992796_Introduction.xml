Otitis media (OM) is the most common cause for a preschool-aged child to visit the hospital and is the most frequent infectious disease that leads to antibiotic prescription worldwide ( Rosenfeld et al., 2001 ;  Ahmed et al., 2014 ). OM causes fever and otalgia and may result in complications such as meningitis or hearing loss ( Kwak et al., 2014 ). Acute otitis media (AOM) is usually related to Eustachian tube dysfunction ( Tysome and Sudhoff, 2018 ). Inflammation in the pharyngeal mucosa can be refluxed into the middle ear through the Eustachian tube. This unwanted secretion in the middle ear may result in an infection and cause AOM. AOM often recurs, resulting in repeated or long-term use of antibiotics.
As OM is often characterized by recurrent intractable infection, several strategies to facilitate treatment have been proposed in addition to antibiotics. Instead of the systemic administration of antibiotics, trans-tympanic local drug delivery by increasing the tympanic membrane permeability has been attempted ( Al-Mahallawi et al., 2017 ;  Abdelbary et al., 2019 ). Biofilm formation is the major issue in intractable OM, and methods for biofilm inhibition have been suggested. The use of anti-DNAB II Fab was reported to reduce eDNA, one of the components of biofilm ( Novotny et al., 2021 ). In addition, the Hydrodebrider system was used to disrupt the biofilm ( Abi Hachem et al., 2018 ). The photosensitizer Chlorin e6 was used to enhance bactericidal activity against biofilm ( Luke-Marshall et al., 2020 ).
Photobiomodulation (PBM) was first discovered by Endre Mester, which is known as “low-level laser therapy” ( Mester et al., 1968 ). Kovacs et al. observed hair growth by applying ruby laser (694 nm) to the skin. Subsequently, they discovered that HeNe laser (632.8 nm) can stimulate wound healing ( Kovacs et al., 1974 ). Currently, similar to lasers, LEDs are used as a light source ( de Freitas and Hamblin, 2016 ). Red (600–700 nm) and near-infrared (NIR) (770–1,200 nm) wavelengths are the most commonly used, which have shown positive biologic effects. The effects of blue and green light have also been investigated; however, there are issues due to the short penetration depth ( Hamblin, 2017 ). PBM has been found to have anti-inflammatory properties with positive effects on wound healing, arthritis, brain and muscle injury healing, inflammatory pain, and autoimmune diseases ( Hamblin, 2017 ). As a non-invasive method, PBM has also shown anti-microbial effects by generating heat (photothermal effect) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Han et al., 2021 ).
In the current study, we investigated the effect of simultaneous red and NIR wavelengths for treating OM. We used a dual red and NIR LED and evaluated its effect on an  in vivo  lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AOM rat model as well as human middle ear epithelial cells (HMEECs) and murine macrophage cells (RAW 264.7)  in vitro .
