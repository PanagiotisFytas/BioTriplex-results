In the present study, owing to the anti-inflammatory effects of dual red and NIR LED irradiation, inflammatory cytokines were inhibited in an LPS-induced AOM rat model, as well as HMEECs and RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, the decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production following LED irradiation was mediated by the blockade of MAPK signaling. Collectively, these findings suggest that red/NIR LED irradiation may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of OM.
