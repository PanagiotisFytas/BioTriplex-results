Metabolic endotoxemia is increasingly reported in the literature, yet there is no gold standard method of analysis for low levels of circulating endotoxins. Human research studies using the LAL assay often poorly report the methodology employed; sample pre-treatment conditions are often not stated [ 36 ], referenced to manufacturer’s instructions (which are non-existent for endotoxin levels observed under conditions of ME using a Lonza kit) [ 37 ], or are scant [ 18 , 30 ].
The key finding of this study was that existing published LAL sample inhibitor neutralization pre-treatments of 70 °C and 80 °C for both 15 and 30 min, vortexed for 2 min and subsequently diluted 1:50, 1:75, 1:100, and 1:200, or diluted 1:10, heat treated to 70 °C for 10 min, vortexed for one minute and ultrasonicated for 10 min or diluted using 0.5% pyrosperse and analyzed using the LAL chromogenic assay were not suitable to detect endotoxin levels in plasma, amongst overweight men typically exhibiting ME. There are two key findings which substantiate this. Firstly, ME has long been associated with obesity. In the current study, obesity (BMI) was significantly related to the indirect measure of endotoxemia (LBP) with a moderate effect size, yet there were no relationships between BMI and the direct measure of endotoxemia (LPS) using the LAL chromogenic assay under any of the sample pre-treatment conditions examined. The positive correlation between BMI and LBP concur with many other research groups [ 9 , 35 , 38 ], including our own [ 34 ], and in varied ethnic populations [ 11 , 12 ], yet surprisingly many research groups reporting on ME measures, particularly those addressing methodology, fail to report on this relationship.
Secondly, the literature commonly reports both the LAL chromogenic assay [ 21 , 30 , 31 ] and LBP ELISA assay for quantifying ME [ 21 , 32 ], despite the mechanisms for detection being very different [ 7 , 16 ]. As such, one would expect to observe a direct positive relationship between both measures in the fasting state. However, this was not the case in our study. Endotoxin levels determined using the LBP ELISA assay failed to correlate with any of the 17 variants of sample pre-treatment for analysis performed using the LAL assay. Interestingly, we have previously failed to find a relationship between LBP and LPS in 10 healthy overweight and obese males in the fasting state (r = −0.341,  p  = 0.369; unpublished data) and Ghamim et al. who used both LAL and LBP assays to measure ME failed to detect a fasting relationship between the two measures of endotoxemia [ 21 ].
There are several possible explanations for this lack of correlation; the most likely was deactivation of endogenous sample compounds capable of interfering with the clotting cascade was incomplete [ 39 , 40 ]. The most common methods reported for ameliorating this inhibition or enhancement have been the combination of dilution and heating [ 25 , 41 , 42 ], solvent extraction [ 39 ], sonication [ 25 , 43 ], and acid treatment [ 41 , 44 ], or combinations thereof. While the most commonly reported heat treatments, dilutions, and the use of sonication were employed in this study, the lack of correlation between LBP and LPS suggests that they were not sufficient to deactivate the inhibitors. Secondly, LBP is produced principally by the liver in response to LPS exposure, making LBP levels dependent on hepatic function, unlike the LAL assay which is a direct measure of LPS activity. In an acute exposure to a bolus of LPS, LBP is consumed by binding to LPS and transported to responding immune cells-producing a paradoxical fall in LBP rather than increase. However, as all of the men in this study were heathy, not experiencing any acute event likely to produce a bolus exposure to LPS, this pattern is unlikely to explain the lack of correlation between LBP and LAL quantified endotoxemia.
Finally, ME mirrors the activity of LPS, which in the case of the LAL analysis is based on the structure of the lipid-A moiety and polysaccharide chain [ 45 ]. We acknowledge that various LPS species exist with numerous activities according to their molecular structure, so it is possible that the increased levels of endotoxin may be the result of an increased number of LPS molecules, or a similar level of LPS molecules with increased activity due to different chemical structures [ 31 ]. It has also been suggested that this discrepancy could be more fully understood by assessing the biochemical forms of LPS in parallel with the LAL assay at an optimum dilution [ 31 ]. However, while this has been successful under conditions of sepsis [ 46 ], correlations for LPS determined by the LAL analysis and biochemical methods of analysis (HPLC-MS/MS) are still lacking under conditions of ME [ 47 ].
The strengths of this study include the quality measures taken to ensure the accuracy of the polynomial model; all correlation coefficients were greater than 0.980, and the agreement between replicates (%CV) was less than 10%. The activation of the LAL test is also easily detected by a fast response in the positive product control (PPC) well. The manufacturer specifies the reactivity of such PPC should lie within 50–200% and we report on compliance to this range and only included samples adhering to this range in the analysis. Additionally, the percentage coefficient of variation between two replicate analyses of the same sample was less than 10% as recommended by the manufacturer. Care was also taken to minimize cross contamination through the use of endotoxin free reagents (LAL water), pipette tips, glass storage containers, etc. [ 32 ], and this was confirmed through the use of ‘reagent blanks’. The type of collection tube has been shown to affect the analysis; in this study, blood was collected in heparin tubes, centrifuged within 3 h of collection and then transferred to endotoxin free glass bottles and stored at −80 °C pending analysis. While others have reported heparin tubes to increase endotoxin levels [ 48 , 49 ] and hydrophobic polymers to bind LPS [ 50 ], in this case, limited storage for 3 h was not found to have an impact on the analysis with no detectable level above the limit of detection.
We acknowledge several potential weaknesses in our study. Laugerette et al. suggested sonication would disperse the aggregates of LPS into smaller and more uniform particles to enhance detection [ 31 ]. The lack of correlation between this measure of LPS and LBP suggest the conditions in our study were insufficient to completely reduce this aggregation; (Digital Pulse Swept Power operating at 43 kHz ± 2 kHz sweep bandwidth with 20 Hz pulses). The study also failed to control for the possible presence of proteases and glucans; it is possible that proteases [ 50 , 51 ] or glucans [ 26 ], if present in sufficient quantities in the blood, could have inhibited the clotting cascade in the LAL assay. The recovery of LPS from serum after it has bound to lipoproteins is also challenging. While some suggest that re-extraction of plasma using chloroform could be used to release LPS from inhibitory proteins and lipoproteins [ 52 ], others report as little as ~0.001% of the spiked biological activity is recovered using this method [ 53 ], suggesting that even after additional preparative work, the majority of LPS in the circulation residing in lipoproteins was not detectable by the LAL assay.
