The LAL method of analysis is often used and importantly reported in peer reviewed literature as a measure to detect endotoxin levels under conditions of ME, despite the manufacturer not endorsing its use under these conditions. However, 17 different pre-treatment methods employed prior to the use of the LAL chromogenic assay failed to show any relationships with BMI or LBP suggesting in its current form, it is unsuitable for use for detecting levels of endotoxin typically seen in ME. LBP is the best available surrogate marker of endotoxin exposure, but cannot be used for measuring acute changes in exposure over short periods of time (minutes/hours). Furthermore, we suggest future studies employing LAL chromogenic methodologies under conditions of ME report correlations with BMI and LBP (or an alternative method of analysis) as a quality measure.
As ME is increasingly emerging as a mediator in many chronic diseases, there is an urgent need for more research to establish a robust ‘gold standard’ analytical tool to determine endotoxin levels in the systemic system, particularly with feeding studies. There are a number of emerging analytical techniques involving biosensors [ 54 ], electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and docking programs in the endotoxin-protein analysis (reviewed in [ 53 ]) that may offer an alternative pending investigation under conditions of ME.
