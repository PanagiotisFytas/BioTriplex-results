2.1. Participant Recruitment
Men aged 18 to 50 years with a BMI > 25 kg/m² were recruited as part of a larger study (South Australian Medical Research Institute (SAMRI), Adelaide, South Australia) over a 3-month period in 2018. This overweight group was targeted as they have been reported to more likely exhibit ME [ 30 , 31 , 32 ], thereby having detectable levels of LPS in plasma. Men with an inflammatory or infective disease and consuming immunosuppressive medication (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), corticosteroids, or fish oil) or supplements that may alter intestinal function (e.g., probiotics, antibiotics in the last month) were excluded. The study was approved by the University of South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee in December 2018 (approval number: 200913).
2.2. Anthropometric Measurements
Anthropometric measures were collected. Height was measured to the nearest 1 cm (Seca, 216, Germany). Weight was measured using a bio-electrical impedance scale (Tanita, UM051, Tanita Corporation of America Inc. Arlington Heights, IL, USA). BMI was calculated using the equation body weight (kg)/height (m 2 ) and classified using the World Health Organization (WHO) ranges; underweight (<18.50 kg/m 2 ), normal weight (18.50–24.99 kg/m 2 ), overweight (25.00–29.99 kg/m 2 ) and obese (>30 kg/m 2 ) [ 33 ].
2.3. Blood Collection
A trained phlebotomist collected venous blood samples into a plastic serum vacuette tube (9 mL, cat no: Lithium Heparin; Greiner, Kremsmünster,  Austria ), which we had shown to be free of endotoxin. All samples were allowed to clot for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 3500  g  at 4 °C for 15 min (Hettich Universal 320R, Geldermalsen, Netherlands). Raw plasma was decanted into pyrogen free tubes (cat: 80-507 USP Type 1 flint borosilicate glass tubes with caps; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) using pyrogen free pipette tips (Cat; BE10051, Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Aliquots of raw serum were stored at −80 °C [ 32 ] pending further analysis.
2.4. Assessment of Metabolic Endotoxemia

           2.4.1. Limulus Amebocyte (LAL) Assay  
           Preparation of Standards 
             Supplementary Table S1 . To prepare standards, a control standard endotoxin (CSE) bottle (Lonza Group Ltd., Walkersville, MD, USA) was reconstituted with LAL reagent water (LRW; lot no. 0000638444, exp: 21/06/2019; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) to make a 50 EU/mL solution. Serial dilutions were prepared in pyrogen free glass tubes (Cat: N207; Lonza, USA; 5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, 0.003, 0.002, and 0.001 EU/mL) according to  
           
             
           Preparations of Plasma Samples 
             Supplementary Table S2 . To inactivate endotoxin-neutralizing agents that inhibit endotoxin activity in the assay, a heat treatment and dilution protocol was employed. Samples were thawed to room temperature and a dry block heater (Ratek, Victoria, Australia) was pre-heated to 70 °C or 80 °C. For 1:10 pre-dilution, pyrogen-free glass tubes (Cat: N207; Lonza, USA) and pyrogen-free pipette tips (Cat: BE10051; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) were used to aliquot 50 µL of sample into 450 µL of LAL reagent water (LRW; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Pre-dilution tubes were incubated at 70 °C for 15 and 30 min and 80 °C for 15 and 30 min per sample and then plunged into ice to cool to room temperature. Once cooled to room temperature, serial dilutions (1:50, 1:75, 1:100, and 1:200) were prepared as per  
           
             
           Preparation of Plasma Samples; Adaption for Ultrasonication 
             All samples were thawed and diluted 1 part in 10 with LRW. Samples were heated at 70 °C for 10 min and then subjected to an ultrasonic bath at 40 °C for 10 min (Digital Pulse Swept Power operating at 43 kHz ± 2 kHz sweep bandwidth with 20 Hz pulses; Soniclean, Transtek system, South Australia, Australia) and vortexed for 1 min to enhance the recovery of endotoxin. 
           
             
           Preparation of Plasma Samples; Adaption for Addition of Pyrosperse 
             30 ] as per  Supplementary Table S2 . All samples were thawed and diluted 1 part in 10 with LRW in pyrogen-free glass tubes (Cat: N207; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) using pyrogen-free pipette tips (Cat: BE10051; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Pre-dilution tubes were incubated at 80 °C for 30 min per sample and then plunged into ice to cool to room temperature. Once cooled to room temperature, serial dilutions were prepared with 0.5% pyrosperse to minimize interferences in the reaction (inhibition or enhancement) [ 
           
             
           LAL Analysis 
             TM  5 software (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). A second instrument was also used in the analysis (Enspire, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA with accompanying software, USA) under the following conditions: incubation in a micro-plate reader for 10 min at 37 °C. One hundred microliters of freshly prepared LAL reagent was added to each well. The plate was shaken for 30 s and the OD of each sample was read at 405 nm immediately after shaking and every 40 s thereafter for a total of 200 reading (133 min). The reaction time was defined, as recommended by the manufacturer, as the time taken for OD to increase by 0.2 units from the initial (baseline) OD value of either standards or samples (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Polynomial models were generated in Microsoft Excel 2010 based on the reaction times in seconds of a series of endotoxin concentrations between 0.001 and 50 EU/mL in LRW. Kinetic-QCL™ LAL kits from a single batch were used in the study (lot TL067Y5MJJ, exp:7/6/2020). The assay also used a Lonza micro-plate reader (ELX808LBS) which was calibrated by a Lonza representative at 405 nm (R = 0.999, slope = 1.656, y intercept = −0.068). One hundred microliters of each sample or standard were pipetted into a 96-well micro-plate (Cat no: 25-340; Lonza Walkersville, MD, USA) in duplicate. In addition, a further aliquot of 100 µL of sample, then a further 10 µL of 5 EU/mL standard in the same well was prepared in duplicate to create a 0.5 EU/mL spike in into the sample. This formed the positive product control (PPC). The plate was incubated in a micro-plate reader for 10 min at 37 °C. One hundred microliters of freshly prepared LAL reagent was added to each well. The plate was shaken for 30 s and the OD of each sample was read at 405 nm immediately after shaking and every 150 s thereafter for a period of 100 min with a Delta mean optical density (mOD) of 200. The data was processed using WinKQCL 
           
             
           Summary of Polynomial Model Validation and Quality Measures 
             Figure 1  for example). The limit of detection (LOD) for all samples was calculated as the minimum standard concentration multiplied by sample dilution level; 1:50 dilution = 0.05 EU/mL, 1:75 = 0.075 EU/mL, 1:100 = 0.1 EU/mL, and 1:200 = 0.2 EU/mL. The coefficient of correlation (r) was ≥0.980 for all polynomial models. Reproducibility was determined by percent coefficient of variation (%C.V.) of reaction times for replicates for all samples and standard solutions as ≤10%. To be included in the analysis, % recovery of positive product controls (%PPC) were between 50–200% as per methodology (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). All blank controls were less than the minimum absorption of the standards and samples. This enabled a polynomial model to be utilized to produce a polynomial model and allow prediction of endotoxin concentrations in individuals with ME (see  
           
             
        

           2.4.2. Lipopolysaccharide Binding Protein (LBP) Endotoxin Measurement 
           34 , 35 ] with the minimum detectable concentration of LBP being 4.4 ng/mL. LBP was determined at 450 nm (using a Multiskan Ascent 96/384 Plate Reader, Oitti, Finland). The data was downloaded in Excel and analyzed using elisaanalysis.com where the OD values of the standards were plotted against logarithmic transformed concentrations of LPS in the standards. The concentration of LPS in each sample was determined by reference to the polynomial model. Metabolic endotoxemia was quantified indirectly by LBP analysis using an ELISA system according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Hycult, Uden, Netherlands) as previously published by our group [ 
        
2.5. Data Interpretation
Based on previous work, in which we observed a significant correlation between BMI and LBP in 10 overweight and obese men (r = 0.649,  p  = 0.042, CI 95  0.028–1.269, [ 34 ]), we believed we required a sample size of 15 overweight and obese men allowing for dropouts to observe a relationship between LBP and BMI in the current study. Statistical analyses were conducted using International business machines corporation (IBM) Statistical Product and Service Solution software, version 24 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All variables were reported as mean ± SD where normally distributed, or as median ± inter quartile range when not normally distributed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Homogeneity was evaluated using Levene’s test of equality. Correlations were assessed using the Pearson method. A two-way ANOVA was employed to determine statistical differences between methods of analysis and sample pre-treatments to determine endotoxin levels. Post-hoc analysis was performed using Tukey analysis. Significance was set at  p  < 0.05.
