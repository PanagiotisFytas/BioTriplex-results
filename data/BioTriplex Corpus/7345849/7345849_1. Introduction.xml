Endotoxin, also known as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is derived from the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane and consists of three key components; the O antigen, core oligosaccharide, and the lipid-A molecule [ 1 ]. These components may facilitate potent activation of innate immunity when triggered by low-grade endotoxemia, as demonstrated by the lipid-A molecule’s interaction with the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), mediating expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 1 ]. The potentiation of a pro-inflammatory state via low presence of endotoxins may progress to the onset of inflammatory diseases [ 2 , 3 ]. The precise levels of endotoxin capable of damaging human health remains unclear, however modestly raised levels of endotoxins in human circulation have been increasingly linked in numerous studies to poor health and diseases such as; cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis [ 3 , 4 ], insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [ 2 ], and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [ 5 ].
Currently, there are three very different analytical techniques to assess human endotoxin levels; the Limulus amebocyte assay (LAL assay), the lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) assay and the endotoxin activity assay (EAA™), which we have previously demonstrated is not suitable for use under conditions of metabolic endotoxemia (ME) [ 5 ]. The LBPenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ( ELISA) assay provides an indirect measurement of sub-acute endotoxin which has been designed specifically for biological samples and measures an acute-phase reactant protein, predominantly produced by the liver, in response to endotoxin exposure [ 6 ]. The biological role of LBP is to deliver endotoxin to a co-receptor CD14, facilitating an interaction between endotoxin and TLR4, triggering a signaling cascade. This ultimately results in up-regulation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 7 , 8 ]. The LBP has been used extensively to detect low levels of ME associated with obesity (body mass index; BMI) [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ]. LBP in serum has also been used to detect endotoxemia in inflammatory bowel conditions, pancreatitis, cirrhosis, and sepsis (reviewed in [ 14 ]). However, the use of an indirect measurement may not be ideal for analyzing rapid changes in LPS exposure, such as postprandial endotoxemia, as the LBP response to endotoxin exposure is delayed and the accuracy of the test is dependent on normal hepatic function for production of the measured binding protein [ 15 ].
In contrast, there are three LAL assays which offer a direct measurement of endotoxin through initiating a blood clotting cascade, as Limulus polyphemus clots with Gram-negative bacteria during infection [ 16 ]. The most commonly used LAL assay is a chromogenic test. Briefly, the conversion of a pro-enzyme to its active form is catalyzed by endotoxin, which then splits p-nitroaniline (pNA) from a colorless substrate, which is quantified by the time taken for the optical density (OD) to increase by 0.2 OD at 405 nm and is quantitatively proportional to the concentration of endotoxin in the sample (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). The LAL assay’s ability to assess endotoxin under conditions of sepsis is undisputed, however the manufacturer cautions that the assay was “not meant for testing blood or blood products, nor are they meant to diagnose, treat, or mitigate any disease or condition such as endotoxemia in man or animals” [ 17 ]. This is because inhibitors of the LAL assay present in complex biological samples, such as blood, interfere with endotoxin identification, particularly at low levels. Despite this, a number of research groups have quantified acute short-term changes in plasma endotoxin in healthy individuals before and after the ingestion of a fatty meal using the LAL assay [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ]. However, none of these research groups have verified the accuracy of the determinations under postprandial ME. Additionally, there is a lack of consistency in the methodology employed under conditions of ME, namely in the variable dilution rates and heat treatments required for adequate inhibition of chemical interferences such as β-glucan [ 26 ], or protein modification in blood [ 27 , 28 ]. Therefore, with significant research interest on the effect of low levels of endotoxin exposure on health [ 29 ], there is a need to establish a gold standard assay to directly test for ME, thereby advancing research the field.
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the LAL chromogenic assay was suitable to detect endotoxins under conditions of ME and if so, to then optimize the conditions of use and validate it against BMI, an established marker of ME and an established assay under conditions of fasting. This would provide a validated direct measure of ME which could be used to evaluate postprandial changes in ME during feeding studies.
