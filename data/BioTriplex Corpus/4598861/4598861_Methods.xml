Cell culture and generation of stable cell lines
Human hepatoma cell lines Huh7, PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B, HepG2, SNU448 and SK-Hep1 were obtained directly from Shanghai Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China), where they were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling, and characterized by mycoplasma detection and cell vitality detection. Cell lines were cultured in Dulbcco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2  incubator. All cell lines were placed under cryostage after they were obtained from the bank and used within 6 months of thawing fresh vials. To generate cell populations stably expressing CXCR4, EZH2 or control plasmids were transfected into Huh7 cells with FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacture's protocol. After 24 h of transfection, stable transfectants were selected in medium containing 800 μg ml −1  G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for 4 weeks. Control-shRNA, CXCR4-shRNA or EZH2-shRNA-engineered SK-Hep1 cells were generated by transducing lentiviral particles containing pRS-CXCR4 human short hairpin RNAs (shRNA; TR313630A, TR313630B and TR313630C; OriGene, Rockville, MD;  Supplementary Table 4 ), pRS-EZH2 human shRNAs (TR304713A, TR304713B and TR304713C,  Supplementary Table 4 ) or pRS-non-silencing Luc-shRNA, and selected with puromycin 2 μg ml −1  for 2 weeks. Pooled populations of transduced cells were used to avoid selection for clonal variants.
Human HCC tissues
Paired ( n =127) HCC and adjacent non-tumour tissues were collected from Nantong Tumor Hospital (Jiangsu, China) from January 2003 to February 2005 after approval by the Research Medical Ethics Committee of Fudan University. Informed consent was provided by each patient. All cases were in accord with the following criteria: diagnosed by postoperative histopathology; complete follow-up data available; no extrahepatic metastasis; no other malignant disease; and no preoperative anticancer therapy. Curative hepatectomy was defined as complete resection of all tumour nodules and the cut surface being free of cancer by histology examination, having no cancerous thrombus in the portal vein and having no extrahepatic metastasis 37 . Patients were redesigned according to the 7th edition TNM classification system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer. Overall survival was calculated from the data of surgery to the data of death or the last follow-up. Recurrence was defined as the emergence of one or several liver enhancing foci at computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging 38 . None of these patients died from operative complications or other factors. The mean age of the patients was 51 years (range, 17–79 years). The last follow-up was May 2012, with a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 1–82 months).
Plasmid construction and transfection
Expression plasmid encoding wild-type CXCR4 was kindly provided by Dr Ann Richmond (Vanderbilt University, Nashiville, TN). Expression plasmid encoding wild-type EZH2 was generated as previous described 39 . The 3′-UTR of CXCR4 was amplified from HepG2 and cloned into the downstream region of a luciferase gene in a modified pGL3 control vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The potential miR-622 binding site in the 3′-UTR of CXCR4 was mutated by the overlap extension PCR method. The primer sets are listed in  Supplementary Table 5 . The DNA constructs were verified by sequencing. Transient and stable transfections with various plasmids were performed as manuscript provided. The miRNA mimic and anti-miRNA molecule of miR-302c, miR-139-5p, miR-9, miR-206, miR-622, or nonspecific control miRNA (miR-nc mimic or anti-miR-nc; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) 100 nM was transfected into hepatoma cells.
Cell proliferation and colony formation assay
Cell proliferation was determined by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo, Kamimashiki-gun Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell proliferation rate was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm with the Universal Microplate Reader (BioTEK Instruments, Minneapolis, MN). Anchorage-independent growth ability was measured by using soft agar colony formation assay. A total of 10 × 10 3  cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 0.3% noble agarose (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). This suspension was laid over DMEM containing 0.6% noble agarose in six-well plates and further overlaid with DMEM. The plates were then incubated for 14 days in a 5% CO 2  incubator at 37 °C, with replenishment of medium every other day. Colonies were imaged using Nikon ECLIPSE TE300 and macroscopically visible colonies in three randomly chosen fields per well were counted for quantification.
Cell migration assay
A QCM 24-well colorimetric cell migration assay (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) was used for this experiment. Hepatoma cell lines were trypsinized and seeded at a concentration of 1 × 10 6  cells per ml in serum-free DMEM. The 24-well plates were then incubated for 24 h in a humidified 5% enriched CO 2  atmosphere. Cells that migrated through the 8-μm pore membranes, located at the bottom of every well insert, were stained and eluted. All experiments were performed in three replicates. Cell migration was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm with the Universal Microplate Reader (BioTEK Instruments, Minneapolis, MN).
  prediction for miR targeting of CXCR4 3′-UTR
Three algorithms were used to predict potential miR targeting of 3′-UTR of CXCR4: Pictar ( http://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/ ); Targetscan ( http://www.targetscan.org/ ); and MiRanda ( http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do ) 40 . To reduce the number of false positives, only the miRs that were predicted by at three algorithms were subsequently validated.
Luciferase activity assay
Luciferase activity was assayed with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The co-expressed Renilla luciferase activity was used for the normalization of transfection efficiency.
Real-time PCR with reverse transcription
Total RNA from frozen tissue specimens and cultured cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quantity and quality were determined by a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington DE). Furthermore, mature miRNA levels were measured by using an NCode miRNA First-strand cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). U6 snRNA (RNU6B) served as an endogenous control. Expression of the primary miR-622 transcript was analysed using a TaqMan Pri-miRNA assay (Assay ID Hs03304667_pri; Applied Biosystems). Primer sets are listed in  Supplementary Table 5 . Real-time PCR was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR system using SYBR Green dye (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described by the manufacture. All determinations were performed in triplicate and in at least three independent experiments. The 2 −ΔΔ Ct method was applied to estimate relative transcript levels.
Western blot
Specimen tissues or tumour cells were homogenized in modified lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% NP-40 and 0.5 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysis were resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk, incubated with primary antibodies ( Supplementary Table 6 ) for overnight at 4 °C and subsequently reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (sc-2004 and sc-2005, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK). Uncropped images of all blots are in  Supplementary Fig. 7 .
DNA methylation analysis
DNA was isolated using the proteinase K/phenol extraction method. Bisulfite conversion was carried out using 1 μg of DNA using an Epitect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen). Bisulfite-treated DNA was amplified with BSP primers located in the miR-622 promoter, forward: 5′- GAAATTGTTGTTTTTAAGAGTGATTGATA -3′ and reverse: 5′- CAACCTCCCAAATAACTAAAACTACA -3′. PCR products were cloned using the pGEM-T Easy Vector system (Promega, Madison, WI). Four individual clones were sequenced. The region assessed by BSP included 14 CpG sites from the miR-622 promoter and average methylation from individual clones was calculated as a percentage of the number of methylated CpG sites over the number of total CpG sites sequenced.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
CHIP assay was performed using the EZ-CHIP chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). following the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitate (IP) complexes were immunoprecipitated with an anti-EZH2, H3K27me3, H3K9me3 antibodies or rabbit IgG antibody ( Supplementary Table 6 ) overnight at 4 °C. The captured genomic DNA was obtained and used for quantitative PCR analysis. Ten per cent of total genomic DNA from the nuclear extract was used as input. The primers used for detection of miR-622 promoter sequence as follows: P1 forward: 5′- GAAGCATCTCCAGACCGAGA -3′, reverse: 5′- CGAGTGGCCGACTCTGGA -3′; P2 forward: 5′- GATTACAGGCATGCGCCAC -3′, reverse: 5′- CACCATAGCTGGACACCTGG -3′; P3 forward: 5′- CGCTGGCTCATGCCTGTAAT -3′, reverse: 5′- CACCACCATGCCTGGCTAAT -3′; P4 forward: 5′- GGAAGCATCTCCAGACCGAG -3′, reverse:5′- CGAGTGGCCGACTCTGG -3′. Amplification efficiency was calculated, and the data were expressed as enrichment related to input.
  hybridization
Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated by an ethanol series. Slides were quenched endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H 2 O 2  for 30 min. Following digestion by proteinase K for 5 min, slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and rinsed in PBS. Slides were incubated in hybridization buffer at 60 °C for 2 h, and incubated with miR-622 or scrambled miRNA control probes (50 nM; digoxigenin-labelled LNA probes, Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) at 60 °C overnight. Stringent wash buffer (50% formamide in 2 × SSC and PBS plus Tween-20 (PBST)) was used. Alkaline phosphatease substrate (nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- phosphate was used for the alkaline phosphate reaction, and the slides were mounted in aqueous mounting medium. Scoring was measured according to the following criterion: 0=absent cell cytoplasm staining; 1=weak cell cytoplasm staining; 2=moderate cell cytoplasm staining; 3=strong cell cytoplasm staining, and the ISH score of percentage multiplying the intensity was recorded 41 . The median value of the ISH score was chosen as the cutoff criterion to dichotomize into high- and low-expression subgroups, and the median value of miR-622 ISH score is 36.
Tumour xenograft experiments
Four- to five-week-old male athymic nude ( Foxn1 nu/nu , BALB/c background) mice were purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China). Mice age 5–6 weeks were injected subcutaneously in the flank on each side with 1 × 10 7  viable SK-Hep1, SK-Hep1-shCon, SK-Hep1-shCXCR4, Huh7-Con or Huh7-CXCR4 cells. Ten mice per cell line were used. Tumour size was monitored by digital caliper. Tumour volume=( L  ×  W 2 )/2, where  L  is length at the widest point of the tumour and  W  is the maximum width perpendicular to  L . When the tumours reached ∼80 mm 3  in diameter, the mice were randomized into treatment groups. The mice were administered subcutaneously daily with a solution AMD3100 (10 mg kg −1 ) or PBS for 3 weeks. Anti-CXCR4 neutralizing antibody (clones 12G5, BD Pharmingen, SanDiego, CA) or irrelevant antibody (IgG2a) (R&D System, Minneapolis, MN) was injected intraperitoneally (1 mg per injection) twice a week for 3 weeks. Mice were sacrificed if the volume of their tumour reached 2,000 mm 3 . All animal procedures were approved and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Fudan University Animal Care and Use Committee (Permit No. 13022708).
Tissue microarray and immunohistochemical staining
Haematoxylin and eosin staining was used to define the diagnostic area, and one representative core (6 mm) was obtained from each case using a tissue arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring, MD). Tissue microarray sections (4 μm) was immunostained with antibodies to CXCR4 (dilution: 1:200,  Supplementary Table 6 ), EZH2 (dilution: 1:400,  Supplementary Table 6 ). Immunohistochemical evaluation was performed independently by two researchers (Y.L. and W.L.) blinded to the clinical data, and cases with discrepant grades were re-evaluated by discussion until consensus was achieved. We classified the IHC staining results into two categories according to subcellular localization of CXCR4, for example, cytoplasmic and nuclear. A semi-quantitative H-score ranged from 0 to 300 was calculated for each specimen by multiplying the distribution areas (0–100%) at each staining intensity level by the intensities (0: negative, 1: weak staining, 2: moderate staining and 3: strong staining) 42 . The median value of the H-score was chosen as the cutoff criterion to dichotomize into high and low expression subgroup. As a result, CXCR4 median H-score is 110 and EZH2 median H-score is 75.
Statistical analysis
All quantified data represent a mean of triplicate samples±s.d. 43  through analysing with GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and assessing comparisons between different groups by the Student's  t -test and one-way analysis of variance. The correlation between CXCR4 and clinicopathologic features was assessed using  χ 2  or Fisher's exact test with Stata software, version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Survival was calculated starting from the data of death or last follow-up. Survival curves were estimated using Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test was used to compute differences between the curves. The correlation between CXCR4 with miR-622 and EZH2 staining by ISH and IHC, were determined using Pearson's coefficient test. Differences were considered significant at values of  P <0.05. All statistical tests were two sided.
