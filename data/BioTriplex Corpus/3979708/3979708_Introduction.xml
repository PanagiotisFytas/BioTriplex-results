Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have a poor clinical outcome, despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment methods. Resection at an early stage gives a relatively favorable outcome, but PDACs are diagnosed in an advanced stage in most cases  [1] . Indolent neoplasms such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) also occur in the pancreas  [2]  and sometimes transform into lesions with an invasive character and a poor outcome  [3] ,  [4] . An IPMN is a mucin-producing cystic neoplasm that was first recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1996 and renamed by the WHO as IPMN in 2000  [5] . Currently, IPMNs are the most common cystic neoplasm of the pancreas, and are classified into gastric, intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and oncocytic types  [2] ,  [6] . We have shown that the outcome of intestinal-type IPMN is poorer than that of gastric-type IPMN, although the outcomes for both IPMNs are significantly better than that with PDAC  [3] ,  [4] . A recent study also showed that the morphological subtype of IPMN is an independent prognostic factor:  i.e.  patients with gastric-type IPMN have a fair prognosis, those with intestinal-type or oncocytic-type IPMN have a relatively less favorable prognosis, and those with pancreatobiliary-type IPMN have the poorest prognosis  [6] .
Mucins play crucial roles in diagnostic and prognostic prediction and in carcinogenesis and tumor invasion. MUC1 (pan-epithelial membrane mucin), the first cloned mucin, is an important human tumor antigen, second only to WT1 in cancer antigen pilot prioritization using a ranking based on predefined and preweighted criteria  [7] . Our series of immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies has shown a consensus position on mucin expression profiles in pancreatic neoplasms as follows  [8] ,  [9] : high expression of MUC1 is observed in PDACs and is related to a poor outcome  [10] ; intestinal-type IPMNs are MUC1-negative but MUC2 (intestinal secretory mucin)-positive, and sometimes show invasive growth with  de novo  MUC1 expression  [3] ,  [4] ,  [11] ; gastric-type IPMNs that are MUC1-negative and MUC2-negative have a low potential for malignancy  [3] ,  [4] ;  de novo  high MUC4 (tracheobronchial mambrane mucin) expression is associated with a poor outcome in patients with PDAC  [12] ; and MUC4 expression is observed mainly in intestinal-type IPMNs  [13] .
We have also found that the methylation status, mRNA expression, and mucin core protein expression were well correlated with each other for MUC1, MUC2, and MUC4 in cancer cell lines  [14] ,  [15] ,  [16] ,  [17] . In addition, we have developed a novel DNA methylation analysis method ‘methylation specific electrophoresis (MSE, international patent open: WO 2011/132798)’. The MSE method greatly decreases the amount of input DNA and has high sensitivity, although conventional analytical methods for DNA methylation require a large amount of DNA and have low sensitivity. The lower detection limit for distinguishing different methylation status is under 0.1% and the detectable minimum amount of DNA is 20 pg, which can be obtained from only a few cells, and has high resolution  [18] . Application of this MSE method in analyses of the epigenetic status of  MUC1 ,  MUC2  and  MUC4  in pancreatic juice may be useful for early detection of pancreatic lesion, as further investigated in the current study.
