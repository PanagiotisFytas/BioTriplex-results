Cell Lines
Human pancreatic carcinoma cell line HPAF II and Human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines Caco2 and LS174T were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HPAF II, Caco2 and LS174T cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Minatoku, Tokyo, Japan) and 100 U/mL of penicillin/100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Sigma). Cell lines with high and low methylation of  MUC1  (Caco2 and LS174T),  MUC2  (HPAF II and LS174T) and  MUC4  (Caco2 and LS174T) were used as control standards in the MSE analysis.
Clinical Samples

           Pancreatic tissues 
           As a basic experiment for the analysis of pancreatic juice, we aimed to examine the relationship between the extent of DNA methylation of mucin genes and the expression level of mRNA in paired pancreatic tissues. Tissue blocks (about 2×2×2 mm) were obtained from neoplastic and non-neoplastic areas of surgically resected fresh specimens of 17 PDACs. 
        

           Pancreatic juice 
           [19] ,  [20] . After completion of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, pancreatic juice was collected using endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage, pancreatic stenting, a bottle-shaped metal tip endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography catheter (5 Fr; MTW Endoskopie Inc., Wesel, Germany)  
        

           Ethics statement 
           The study was conducted in accordance with the guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Collection of samples was approved by the ethical committees of each hospital (Ethical committees of Kagoshima University Hospital, Chiba Cancer Center Hospital, Osaka Medical College Hospital, Nanpuh Hospital and Kyoto University Hospital), and informed written consent was obtained from each patient. All studies using human materials in this article were approved by the ethical committee of Kagoshima University Hospital (revised 20–82 and revised 22–127). 
        
Extraction and Quantification of mRNA
Total RNA was extracted from cell lines, human pancreatic tissues and pancreatic juices using a RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed with a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time reverse transcription–PCR was performed on a ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was normalized to the β-actin mRNA level in each sample. Primer sets are shown in  Table S1 .
Extraction of DNA and Bisulfite Modification
DNA from cell lines, pancreatic tissue, and pancreatic juice was extracted using a DNeasy Tissue System (QIAGEN). Bisulfite modification of the genomic DNA was carried out using an Epitect Bisulfite Kit (QIAGEN). Purification of PCR products was carried out using a Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega KK, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan).
MSE Analysis
MSE analysis was performed as follows. In the preparation of the samples step, the target DNA fragments were amplified by nested PCR approach using bisulfite treated DNA. The using primer sets were shown in  Table S1 . In the electrophoresis step, the amplicon was applied to the D-Code system (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) using polyacrylamide gel with linear denaturant gradient at 60°C, 70 V for 14 h. The detailed informations of MSE method were described in our previous study  [18] . The band intensity was measured by Image J software (National Institutes of Health < http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ >). The unmethylation index (U-index) was calculated as U-index  =  (highest band intensity/total band intensity)  sample /(highest band intensity/total band intensity)  basal cell line ×100. Thus, the U-index in each sample was normalized using data from a hypomethylated cell line.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using the “R” computing environment  [21] . The normality of the data distribution was evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differences between groups were analyzed by Student t-test or Welch t-test. A nonparametric test of group difference was performed by Mann–Whitney U test. Correlations were tested using single regression analysis. Quadratic discrimination analysis and canonical discriminant analysis were performed with the R add-on MASS package  [22] . The threshold value and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis  [23] . A p value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Immunohistochemical Staining
IHC was performed in cut sections of pancreatic tumors using anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) clone 014E (MAb MUC1/014E, generated by one of us, Suguru Yonezawa)  [24] ; anti-MUC2 MAb clone Ccp58 (MAb MUC2/Ccp58, Novocastra Reagents, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK) and anti-MUC4 MAb clone 8G7 (MAb MUC4/8G7, generated by one of us, Surinder K. Batra)  [25] , using the immunoperoxidase method. Antigen retrieval was performed using CC1 antigen retrieval buffer (pH 8.5, EDTA, 37°C, 30 min; Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA) for all sections. Following incubation with the primary antibodies (MAb MUC1/014E diluted 1∶5, 37°C, 32 min; MAb MUC2/Ccp58 diluted 1∶200, 37°C, 32 min; MAb MUC4/8G7 diluted 1∶3000, 37°C, 32 min) in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS) with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), sections were stained on a Benchmark XT automated slide stainer using a diaminobenzidine detection kit (UltraView DAB, Ventana Medical Systems). The control staining using normal mouse serum or PBS-BSA instead of the primary antibodies always showed no reaction.
