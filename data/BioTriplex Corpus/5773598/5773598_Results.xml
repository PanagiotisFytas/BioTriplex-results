Initial presentation
A six-year old girl presented with recurring headaches, and upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a cystic and solid mass within the superior aspect of the left parietal lobe anterior to the central sulcus was observed (Specimen  A ). After surgical resection, histological examination revealed an unusual tumour with solid, solid papillary and papillary histological growth patterns. Tumour cells were radially orientated around often hyalinised vascular walls, forming perivascular pseudo-rosettes. There was focal necrosis and numerous mitoses (up to 28 per 10 high power fields). The tumour cells were positive for vimentin and exhibited patchy positive staining for GFAP and S-100, as well as focal positivity for EMA (Fig.  1 ). Sections were negative for SMA, MSA, desmin, myogenin, myoglobin, neurofilament protein and cytokeratin 34 Beta E12 (not shown). Conventional cytogenetics identified loss of an X chromosome and partial deletion of 22q. Differential diagnoses included high grade glioma, anaplastic ependymoma and rhabdoid papillary meningioma, but the pathologic features were thought to be most consistent with an astroblastoma with malignant features. No adjuvant chemotherapy was administered after gross total resection.

Recurrences
Over the course of the next 10 years, the patient underwent a further 10 invasive procedures to remove a highly recurrent tumour (Fig.  2 ). She was treated with chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide after the second surgery at age 7.33 years ( B ), and combined CCNU/temozolomide after a third surgery at age 9.11 years ( C ). Subsequent to this, later recurrences were removed without further radio- or chemotherapy. A representative T1 weighted axial MRI series for all 11 lesions and a final progression image is provided (Fig.  3 ). The anatomical locations ranged from the left frontal/fronto-parietal lobes ( A-E ), parietal parafalcine region ( F ), temporal lobe ( G, I ), sphenoid region ( H ) and nasal cavity ( J, K ). The histology for all samples were consistent with that of recurrent anaplastic astroblastoma, with a varying degree of atypical mitoses, pseudorosettes, hyalinised vessels and necrosis (Fig.  4 ). An exception is the seventh surgery ( G ) which was the most pleomorphic of the samples, and appeared upon radiological review to be an entirely separate lesion away from the site of the primary tumour and considered to represent a local metastasis.

Identification of MN1:BEND2 fusion
FFPE material was available for all 11 specimens, with three tumours having sufficient frozen sample ( F ,  H ,  I ), providing material for RNA sequencing. Analysis for fusion transcripts in these latter samples showed a consistent apparent inter-chromosomal translocation between  MN1  (meningioma disrupted in balanced translocation 1, 22q12.1) and  BEND2  (BEN domain containing 2, Xp22.13) (Fig.  5A ). This structural variation involves a deletion at chromosome 22q and breakpoints in intron 1 of  MN1  and intron 8 of  BEND2 , rearrangement, and results in an expressed transcript comprising exon 1 of  MN1  and exons 9 though 14 of  BEND2 . This was validated in the frozen samples by RT-PCR (Fig.  5B ), and the FFPE specimens by custom FISH probes (Fig.  5C ) (Supplementary Figure  S1 ). The consequence of this fusion is increased expression of  BEND2 , as seen by exon-level sequence coverage by RNA sequencing (Fig.  5D ).

Tumour evolution
Exome sequencing was carried out on all surgical specimens (Supplementary Figure  S2 ). A total of 110 somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and InDels were found in any one or more of the samples (4–36 per specimen, median = 13). The highest number were found in resection  G  (n = 36). Calculating the cancer cell fractions (CCFs) for the somatic variants allowed for a temperospatial reconstruction of the tumour phylogeny based upon common, shared and private events (Fig.  6A ). Aside from the  MN1:BEND2  fusion, only a single common mutation was observed in all specimens – a small deletion (p.1211delQ) in  GIGYF2  (GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2).

Intratumoral heterogeneity and phylogentic reconstruction. (
The interpretation of multi-sample sequencing data can be heavily influenced by the extent of intratumoral heterogeneity present across the tumour(s). To assess this, we investigated the subclonal architecture of each specimen using EXPANDS (Fig.  6B ). The number of major subclones ranged from 4–10, with the exception of specimen  J , which appeared to be largely clonal, and notably distinct from the multi-clonal specimen  K . Strikingly different compositions from the initial presentation were also observed in the spatially distinct specimens  D  (a considerably more complex subclonal architecture compared to  A, B  and  C)  and  G  (dominated by a predominant clone) (Fig.  6B ).
Upon phylogenetic reconstruction, the samples were split in two main branches (Fig.  6C ). The first included the primary presentation within the frontal lobe ( A ) and the closely-related local recurrences  B  and  C . These were found to have few chromosomal alterations and 8–10 somatic SNVs/InDels. Specimen  D , resected from the fronto-parietal region, was distinguished by several additional alterations including missense variants in the paracaspase  MALT1  and acquisition of gain of chromosome 13q. Notably, the other samples in this branch were from the latest surgeries acquired from the nasal cavity ( J  and  K ), which shared the relatively stable copy number genome and few mutations, though  K  had acquired several additional variants including the BCL2-associated transcription factor  BCLAF1 .
The remaining samples were found on a second major branch (Fig.  6C ). Sample  G  formed a branch separate from the other resections, reflecting its distinct radiopathological features, location within the temporal lobe, and with few chromosomal changes but a large number of private mutations including missense mutations in the serine/threonine kinase  MAP3K1  and lysine demethylase  KDM5A . The other four samples were associated with the acquisition of a large number of DNA copy number changes, particularly whole chromosomal arm gains, as well as mutation in  LRRC4 . Two specimens resected from the parafalcine region ( E ) and the vertex superior to the frontal lobe ( F ) formed their own sub-branch, the former acquiring a truncating mutation in the meiotic recombination protein  REC8 , the latter a missense variant in  MAP3K7 . Finally, a further sub-branch was found to contain the remaining tumours  H  and  I , resected from the sphenoid region and temporal lobe, respectively.
The concordance of these distinct sub-branches having apparently independently acquired mutations in genes associated with NF-κB signalling ( MALT1, BCLAF1, MAP3K1, LRRC4  and  MAP3K7 ) prompted us to investigate pathway activation by immunohistochemistry for RELA-p65 (Fig.  7 ). Whilst only very weak staining was observed in specimens  A ,  B  and  C  (absent these mutations), all other tumours showed strong nuclear-cytoplasmic accumulation of staining indicative of NF-κB signalling. This was associated with the increased expression of the target gene  IL8  in specimens for which RNAseq data was available, compared to a series of hemispheric high grade glioma (HGG) samples (Supplementary Figure  S3A ). In an independent series of brain tumour samples,  IL8  gene expression was found to be at equivalent levels to  C11orf95-RELA  fusion-positive ependymoma, and significantly elevated compared to AT/RT, HGG and medulloblastoma. Figure 7 D – K ), and only weakly observed in ( A – C ). Main image, original magnification x200; inset x400. NF-κB pathway activation. Strong cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of RELA/NF-κB-p65 by immunohistochemistry is seen in all later specimens (
Interpreting the molecular and clinical data together, we propose an evolutionary history whereby after acquisition of the primary driving  MN1:BEND2  fusion ( A ), there was an early spread of tumour cells from the original site after initial chemoradiotherapy and surgery, with divergence along several pathways (Fig.  8 ). The first involved little genomic instability, with local recurrence in the frontal lobes ( B ,  C ) and an evolutionarily independent spread to parietal regions ( D ), followed >5 years later by eventual migration such that the latest surgical interventions were in the nasal cavity ( J ,  K ). These latter two samples had remarkably different subclonal compositions, suggestive of distinct temporal origins. In parallel were three metastatic routes involving distinct anatomical regions. The first appears to be an early escape to the temporal lobe ( G ), with few overlapping somatic alterations with the primary tumour, and predominantly clonal. The latter two seem to occur after the acquisition of major chromosomal changes reminiscent of genome doubling, and diverged along either superior ( E ,  F ) or inferior ( H ,  I ) paths over the course of 18 months.

Taking all available data, we proposed an evolutionary history along four distinct trajectories over 10 years. Brain diagram modified from Patrick J. Lynch, medical illustrator; C.
