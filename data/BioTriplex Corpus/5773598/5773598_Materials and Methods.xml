Case and samples
All patient material was collected after informed consent and subject to the Children’s Health Queensland Human Research Ethics Committee local research ethics committee approval, and all procedures performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumours samples were available for all 11 resections (termed  A – I ) with frozen tumour available for 4 of these ( E ,  F ,  H  and  I ). Detailed histopathological assessment was carried out on haematoxylin and eosin stained sections. Pre-gadolinium sagittal and axial T1, axial T2 FLAIR and diffusion weighted scans of the whole brain were performed with post gadolinium coronal and axial T1 weighted scans also acquired.
Immunohistochemistry
Standard 4 µm formalin fixed paraffin embedded histologic sections of tumour were stained with the antibodies, EMA clone E29 at 1:100 (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), GFAP polyclonal at 1:1000 (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and S100 polyclonal at 1:2000, (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), using a Leica Bond III (Leica Biosystems) automated immunohistochemical stainer. Staining for NF-κB p65 D14E12 (Cell Signalling, The Netherlands) was undertaken on a Leica Bond Max automated immunohistochemical stainer with protocol F, at an antibody concentration of 1:500, after heat induced epitope retrieval at pH 6 for 20 minutes.
DNA extraction and sequencing
At least 400ng DNA was sent for exome sequencing at the Tumour Profiling Unit, ICR, London, UK using the 50 Mb Agilent SureSelect platform (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and paired-end-sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq. 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a 100 bp read length. Reads were aligned to the hg19 build of the human genome using bwa v 0.7.5a (bio-bwa.sourceforge.net), and PCR duplicates removed with PicardTools 1.5 (pcard.sourceforge.net). Somatic single nucleotide variants were called using the Genome Analysis Tool Kit v3.3-0 based upon current Best Practices using local re-alignment around indels, downsampling and base recalibration with variants called by the Unified Genotyper (broadinstitute.org/gatk). Variants were annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor v71 (ensembl.org/info/docs/variation/vep) incorporating SIFT (sift.jcvi.org) and PolyPhen (genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2) predictions, COSMIC v64 (sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic) and dbSNP build 137 (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/SNP) annotations. Copy number was obtained by calculating log 2  ratios of tumour/normal coverage binned into exons of known genes, smoothed using circular binary segmentation (bioconductor.org) and processed using in-house scripts. We also determined the somatic allele-specific copy number profiles using read depth from whole genome/ exome sequencing as above analysed by ASCAT 10 , which also provided for an estimate of the non-neoplastic cell contamination of the sample as well as the overall ploidy of the tumour. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was also calculated using ASCAT based upon a minor allele frequency < 0.2. Allele-specific copy number, LOH and tumour cell purity were then used to calculate the cancer cell fraction (CCF) which estimates the percentage of tumour cells carrying each mutation 11 , and truncated to 100% where experimental variability in sequence reads produced a value greater than this figure. Intratumoral heterogeneity and the number and frequency of sub-populations within individual tumour samples were calculated with the EXPANDS algorithm using evolutionary biology principles including the Shannon and Simpson indices, and allowing for the concept that subclones may share a subset of variants that may be nested within each other 12 . All data are deposited in the European Genome-phenome Archive (ebi.ac.uk/ega) under accession number EGAS00001002432.
RNA extraction and sequencing
RNA was extracted from frozen tumour tissue following the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit protocol (Qiagen), quantified on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), and sequenced on an Illumina GA-II genome analyser as 100 bp paired end reads. RNA sequences were aligned to hg19 and organised into de-novo spliced alignments using bowtie2 and TopHat2 (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat). Raw read counts and fragments per kilobase per million reads mapped (FPKPM) were calculated for all known Ensembl genes in assembly v74 using bedtools (bedtools.readthedocs.org) and Cufflinks (cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/). Putative fusions were identified using Chimerascan 0.4.5 (code.google.com/archive/p/chimerascan/). Published RNAseq data was taken from Mackay  et al . 13 , whilst published Affymetrix gene expression array data was taken from Sturm  et al . 8 .
MN1:BEND2 RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted frozen samples using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript II system (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Four PCR primers (Life Technologies) were designed using Primer3, ± 200 bp from the breakpoints to generate amplicons spanning the breakpoint-junction-sequences of the predicted fusion. The following primers were used:  MN1  Fwd1 - CAGCAGTTCAGCATCTCCGA,  BEND2  Rev1 - TTGTACGGCCAGCAAATGGA,  MN1  Fwd2- CATTGACCTGGACTCGCTGA,  BEND2  Rev2 - TGACGCTGTTTTCCGTGTTG. cDNA from KNS42 was used as control. PCR was carried out with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Life Technologies) in a 25 μl volume using a 2-Step-Touchdown programme: (94 °C 30 sec, 68 °C 45 sec, 72 °C 1 min, 18 cycles; 94 °C 30 sec, 50 °C 45 sec, 72 °C 1 min, 30 cycles), and cleaned up with the IllustraTM ExoStarTM 1-STEP kit (VWR). Sanger DNA sequencing of the PCR products was performed by DNA Sequencing & Services (MRCPPU, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, dnaseq.co.uk) using Applied Biosystems Big-Dye Ver 3.1 chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 3730 automated capillary DNA sequencer.
MN1:BEND2 FISH
BAC clones were purchased from BACPAC Resources Center (Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA, USA) and FISH-mapped onto metaphase slides to ensure specificity. BACs used were:  MN1  (FITC / DIG) - RP11-145O03, RP11-166A15;  BEND2  (Spectrum Orange / biotin) - RP11-768A24, RP11-46N14. BAC DNA was amplified from 10ng starting material using the IllustraTM GenomiPhi V2 DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Probes were labelled with either biotin or DIG using the BioPrime DNA Labelling System (Life Technologies). Tissue slides were stripped of paraffin using xylene, pre-treated with 0.2 M HCL and 8% sodium thiocyanate for 30 minutes or Spot-light pre-treatment buffer (Life Technologies) at 80 °C for 1hr, digested in 0.025% pepsin (Sigma) in 0.01 M HCL at 37 °C for 20–70 minutes or twice in Digest-All pepsin solution (Life Technologies) for 21 minutes before adding a prepared probe mix with (75%) hybridization buffer under a coverslip and denatured for 5 minutes at 80 °C on a heat block. They were then incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 37 °C, mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK), and captured on the Metafer Scanning and Imaging platform (MetaSystems, Altlussheim, Germany) at x60 using filters for DAPI, Cy3 and FITC.
