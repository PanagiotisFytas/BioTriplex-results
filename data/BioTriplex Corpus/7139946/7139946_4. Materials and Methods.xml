4.1. Quantitative HR-MAS NMR Spectroscopy of Prostate Biopsies
As previously described [ 19 ], ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies were acquired from 30 patients [15 from benign regions of the peripheral zone, 11 from regions of low-grade (Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4) cancer, and 4 from regions of high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3) cancer] after approval by the UCSF Institutional Review Board (IRB) and informed consent using an 18- gauge needle (15-mm X 1-mm cores). Biopsies were placed in individual cryovials and snap-frozen on dry ice (≤15 s) immediately after the procedure. The tissues were processed for HR–MAS NMR, as described by Tessem et al. [ 40 ]. Briefly, each biopsy was weighed prior to loading into an HR–MAS rotor with a known mass of 3.0 μL of deuterium oxide containing 0.75% weight/volume sodium-3- trimethylsilylpropionate-2,2,3,3-d4 (D 2 O + TSP). Quantitative  1 H HR–MAS NMR was performed at 11.7 T Varian INOVA NMR with a 4-mm gHX nanoprobe (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA ) at 1 °C, and 2250 Hz spin rate. Fully relaxed pulse-acquire spectra were acquired with a 2-s presaturation delay, 2-s acquisition time, 40,000 points, 20,000-Hz spectral width, and 128 transients. The data were processed and quantified using the previously published HR–QUEST technique using ERETIC, an electronic reference to access ex vivo concentrations [ 60 ], yielding absolute concentrations of lactate [ 40 ].
4.2. Prostate Tissue Slice Acquisition and Culture
Prostate tissues were obtained with approval by the IRB at UCSF (10-02033) and Stanford University (13895) and informed consent. Fresh tissue cores (8-mm diameter) were obtained from 37 radical prostatectomy specimens immediately following surgery from 12 regions of benign peripheral zone, 20 regions of low-grade (Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4) cancer, and 6 regions of high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3) cancer. Clinical characteristics of the tissue donors (age, serum PSA, and stage) are provided in  Table 1 . Each tissue core was mounted in a Krumdieck tissue slicer (Alabama Research and Development, Munford, AL, USA) and rapidly sectioned (300- to 400-μm thickness) while immersed in chilled HEPES-buffered saline. The tissue slices were then placed on titanium grids in 6-well dishes containing Complete PFMR-4A with 50 nM of R1881 [ 31 , 61 ]. Following overnight culture on a rotator specifically designed for tissue slice culture (Alabama Research and Development) at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO 2 , viability was assessed using a LIVE/DEAD ®  Viability/Cytotoxicity assay (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The TSCs were then placed in the bioreactor for dynamic HP  13 C NMR spectroscopy and subsequent immunohistochemical and biochemical assays.
4.3. 3D Tissue Culture NMR-Compatible Bioreactor
The micro-engineered 5-mm bioreactor is a sophisticated perfusion system, under pressure with a continuous flow of 37 °C media at 0.5 mL/min and 20% oxygen to maintain the physiologic and functional properties of tissue cultures [ 62 ]. A specially designed, precision 3D printed cartridge was used to gently restrain 4–6 tissue slices (60–80 mg) from each patient per bioreactor study in the active region of the radiofrequency (RF) coil to ensure maximal sample filling and B o  homogeneity.
4.4. NMR Spectroscopy Measurements of Prostate TSCs
 P spectra were obtained to monitor tissue viability and to evaluate the metabolic profile of benign and malignant prostate TSCs using a sweep width of 20 KHz, 40,000 points, and 2048 repetitions immediately preceding the HP  13 C experiment. The phosphorous spectra were quantified using ERETIC [ 60 ], implemented on the X-channel of the NMR spectrometer. The ERETIC peak area was periodically calibrated against known concentrations of ATP standards. The metabolite peak areas were used to calculate their concentrations based on the ATP-calibrated ERETIC peak area, after accounting for the differential relaxation rates (T 1 ) [ 36 ]. 
For HP  13 C studies, [1- 13 C]pyruvic acid (14.2 M) and the trityl radical OX063 (15 mM) (GE HealthCare, New York, NY, USA) were polarized using the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization method in the HyperSense (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK) and subsequently dissolved in phosphate buffer, as previously described [ 35 ]. NMR data were acquired on a narrow bore 11.7 T Varian INOVA equipped with a 5 mm broadband probe. HP  13 C spectra were acquired dynamically (30 degree pulses, 3 s temporal resolution for 300 s) following injection of 750 µL of the 4 mM pyruvate dissolution solution into the bioreactor with continuous flow in 90 s.
All HP  13 C data were processed using ACD Lab with 5 Hz broadening and Lorentzian peak fitting. The HP data are presented as mean ratio of lactate to pyruvate peak area under the entire dynamic curve (AUC Lac/Pyr ) and is computed as = where  n  is the number of dynamic time points acquired [ 63 , 64 ], by summing all the spectra and taking the ratio of the peak areas of lactate to pyruvate. This ratio was also normalized to nmols of β-NTP in order to correct for differences in the amount of viable tissue between bioreactor studies experiments in the active region of the RF coil and scaled by 10 -5 . Only those peaks with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of at least 5 were included in the analysis.
4.5. Measurement of TSC Lactate Efflux Rate
Some of the tissue slices after overnight culture (and not used for the bioreactor experiments) were used to measure the rate of lactate efflux. One slice per well (placed on the titanium mesh) was incubated in Complete PFMR-4A with 50 nM of R1881 (as mentioned above) containing 25 mM [3- 13 C]pyruvate. The rate of lactate efflux from the tissue slices was evaluated by collecting the medium every 60–120 min over 8 h and replacing with fresh medium at each time point. Fully relaxed  1 H NMR spectra were obtained for each of the sampled media with a known mass of D 2 O + TSP in an 800 MHz Bruker DRX spectrometer equipped with a cryo-cooled 5mm triple-axis heteronuclear probe using 12,288 points, sweep width of 12 KHz, and 32 repetitions. To quantify the [3- 13 C]lactate produced and exported by the tissue slices from the [3- 13 C]pyruvate taken-up from the medium, N = 4 high-grade cancer, N = 3 low-grade cancer, and N = 3 benign slices were used. The data was processed using ACD/Labs software and the J-coupled  13 C satellite resonance areas of the lactate were quantified.
4.6. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Immediately after the bioreactor and  1 H HR-MAS spectroscopy experiments, the tissue slices and biopsies were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and sectioned at 5-μm for immunohistochemical staining. As described in previous studies [ 19 ], each section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). An experienced prostate cancer pathologist reviewed each section on two separate days and determined the Gleason score [ 65 ] in addition to the percentage of benign epithelium, stroma, and cancer cells in each tissue section based on the H&E staining ( Table 1 ). The tissues were grouped into 3 cohorts: benign (no cancer present), low-grade cancer (Gleason score ≤3 + 4) and high-grade cancer (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3). Additionally, the percentage of cancer comprised of Gleason grade 4 was assessed for each low-grade cancer tissue slice. The pathologist also marked regions of benign epithelium and cancer on the sections which were used as guidelines to scrape the respective tissue from the OCT embedding for further RNA extraction in case of biopsy and LDH activity for the tissue slices. Furthermore, the tissue slices were stained with anti-MCT4 antibody (rabbit polyclonal primary antibody SC-376140 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) in 1:100 dilution at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with rabbit secondary antibody/ HRP at 1:200 dilution for 20 min at room temperature as before [ 49 ], to detect MCT4 at the cell membrane.
4.7. Image Analysis of MCT4 IHC
H&E- and MCT4-stained tissue sections were imaged with a Nikon 6D microscope under bright-field illumination using a 0.15 µm 2  in-plane resolution. The images were processed using Matlab’s color thresholding toolbox. First, the image in the hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space was thresholded with the hue values on the interval of [0,0.176] to capture the brown, the interval of [0.45,1.000] for the saturation values, and the intensity values in the interval of [0,0.535] to capture the darkest brown staining for expression of MCT4 on the cell membrane. Next, image regions focused on the cancer cells were analyzed from the resulting binary image, and the total pixel count of the detected regions was quantified as a % of the entire area. Two to four focal regions per case were imaged and analyzed for MCT4 expression and the mean values are reported.
4.8. Biochemical and Molecular Assays
Tissue slices were homogenized after 24 h of culture and assayed for ATP content. ATP concentration was measured in the TSCs using the StayBrite ATP bioluminescence kit (BioVsion Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) and the Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Frozen tissue (3–5 mg) was homogenized using the Tissuelyser LT (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) for measurement of LDH activity. The enzyme activity was quantified using a standard calorimetric method of measuring the initial enzyme velocity as a linear decrease in absorbance of NADH using varying concentrations of pyruvate added to homogenized tissue lysates [ 19 ].
Total RNA was extracted from tissues with an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) and qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression of the  LDHA  gene utilizing primers purchased from Applied Biosystems (Hs01378790_g1). As described previously [ 19 ], reverse transcription using an iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was performed and the cDNA generated was utilized for PCR in triplicate with TaqMan chemistry on the ABI 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The mRNA expression of  LDHA  was calculated relative to the housekeeping gene  ACTB  (Amplicon:TACGCCAACACAGTGCTGTCTGGCGGCACCACCATGTACCCTGGCATTGCCGACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGATCACTGCCCTGGCACCCAGCACAATGAAGATCAAGATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGCGCAAGTACTCCGTGTGGATCGGCGGC, Forward: TACGCCAACACAGTGCTGTCT, Reverse: GCCGATCCACACGGAGTACT, Probe: ATCAAGATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGCGC).
4.9. Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using PRISM (GraphPad Software, San diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparisons, one-way ANOVA was used with a 2-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli for post-hoc tests using a false discovery rate, Q < 0.05. All data are represented as mean ± standard error and significant ( p  < 0.05) differences between the groups are denoted by an asterisk (*  p  < 0.05 and > 0.005, ** for  p  < 0.005 and > 0.0005, and *** for  p  < 0.0005). The relationship between HP AUC lac/pyr  and percentage of Grade 4 cancer cells was assessed by the nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient ( r ).
