Management of patients with localized PCa relies heavily on characteristics, such as the Gleason grade and amount of cancer, of transrectal ultrasound targeted biopsies. However, prostate biopsies suffer from large sampling errors, typically sampling only a small percentage of the prostate, and fail to accurately discriminate aggressive versus indolent disease in many patients [ 14 ]. A non-invasive imaging method that can detect potentially high-grade aggressive PCa anywhere in the prostate at diagnosis and during active surveillance could aid in the selection of patients needing treatment and assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment. A cut point of Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3 is often used clinically for defining high-grade/aggressive PCa that requires definitive treatment [ 37 , 38 , 39 ]. This study provides the first evidence of a significant increase of tumor lactate in high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3) as compared to low-grade (Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4) PCa, i.e., an increased Warburg effect in living patient-derived tissue slices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the significant increase in the Warburg effect in high-grade PCa occurs in conjunction with increased lactate efflux via increased MCT4 expression. These findings can potentially provide two non-invasive imaging biomarkers for discriminating indolent from aggressive PCa.
This study reports, for the first time, a Gleason grade-dependent increase in lactate concentration and  LDHA  mRNA expression in PCa snap-frozen patient biopsies. In a prior quantitative  1 H HR-MAS study of snap-frozen benign and PCa biopsies, a significant 2.6-fold increase in tissue lactate concentration was observed in malignant versus benign biopsies [ 40 ]. However, an insufficient number of biopsies containing cancer of varying pathologic grades was assayed in the prior study to determine if there was a significant change in lactate concentration with pathologic grade. In this study, significant increases in tissue lactate concentration were observed between benign tissue and low-grade PCa (1.4-fold), between benign tissue and high-grade cancer (4-fold), and, more importantly, between low- and high-grade PCa (2.9-fold) ( Figure 1 A). Furthermore, the cancer- and grade-dependent increases in lactate concentration in biopsies correlated with mRNA expression of  LDHA , the gene that encodes the LDH enzyme subunit with the highest affinity for reduction of pyruvate to lactate. Specifically, there was a 1.6-fold increase in  LDHA  expression in high- versus low-grade PCa.  LDHA  expression levels have been previously correlated with prostate cancer progression, metastasis, and biochemical recurrence [ 41 , 42 ]. Unfortunately, the ability to detect tissue lactate in in vivo  1 H MRSI studies of PCa is inhibited by large contributions from lipids that surround the prostate and whose resonances overlap the lactate resonance chemical shift [ 20 ].
The increased signal enhancement provided by HP  13 C MR and the lack of background  13 C signals from lipids makes it an ideal technique for assessing PCa pathologic grade in vivo based on changes in HP [1- 13 C]lactate. While a prior HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate prostate tissue slice bioreactor study demonstrated a significant increase in HP [1- 13 C]lactate in PCa relative to benign prostate tissues [ 19 ], this is the first study to investigate a sufficient number of patient-derived TSCs to provide a correlation between HP [1- 13 C]lactate and pathologic grade. Specifically, there was a 1.8-fold increase in HP [1- 13 C]lactate in TSCs with PCa (both high- and low-grade) relative to benign TSCs, similar to the prior bioreactor study [ 19 ]. Moreover, this study demonstrates that high-grade PCa is not only associated with significantly higher lactate but also rapid HP [1- 13 C]lactate efflux, as a result of high MCT4 expression, compared to low-grade PCa and benign prostate tissue. The lack of increased total HP [1- 13 C]lactate (extracellular and intracellular) signal in high- versus low-grade PCa observed in the bioreactor study is due to a 1.4-fold increase in the rate of lactate efflux as measured by [3- 13 C]pyruvate studies in high-grade PCa and subsequent loss of signal of the HP [1- 13 C]lactate in the media due to the flow conditions employed in the bioreactor experiment. This loss of HP [1- 13 C]lactate due to efflux and media flow has been validated in several prior bioreactor studies of renal cancer cells [ 35 , 36 ]. Further biological evidence supporting a significant increase of lactate and its efflux in high- versus low-grade PCa TSCs include: (1) Significant elevation of LDH activity in high-grade cancer TSCs (2.7- and 2.2-fold relative to benign and low-grade cancer TSCs, respectively), while the difference in LDH activity was not significant between TSCs with low-grade PCa and benign TSCs; and (2) Significant elevation of MCT4, the predominant symporter of lactate and proton efflux, in high-grade cancer TSCs (3-fold increase in high- versus low-grade PCa and benign prostate TSCs), while there was no significant difference in MCT4 expression between low-grade PCa and benign TSCs.
The significant increase in MCT4 observed in high-grade PCa TSCs is also consistent with prior publications indicating that high MCT4 expression predicts aggressive disease in many cancers [ 43 ], and specifically in PCa, where it has been shown to correlate with high-grade cancer (Gleason ≥ 7) and other clinical characteristics associated with poor prognoses, such as higher serum PSA levels at diagnosis and extension of cancer through the prostatic capsule [ 29 , 30 , 44 ]. MCT4 is a low-affinity monocarboxylate transporter that is primarily responsible for the export of lactate and its associated proton from the cell [ 37 , 38 ] and, like other glycolytic enzymes, is upregulated by hypoxia (unlike other isoforms of MCT) [ 39 ]. Apart from MCT4, MCT1 is the other monocarboxylate transporter expressed in PCa. MCT1 has a higher affinity (>6-fold) for pyruvate over lactate transport [ 45 ] and does not contribute to the net transport of lactate [ 46 ]. Furthermore, it has been shown that when solid tumors co-express both isoforms, inhibition of MCT1 reduces cell proliferation but does not alter lactate efflux via MCT4 [ 47 ] and confers drug resistance in hypoxia [ 48 ], suggesting a lactate-transport independent role of MCT1 promoting tumor proliferation.
Another important finding of this study is that the HP [1- 13 C]lactate has an inverse relation with the percentage of Gleason grade 4 in low-grade cancers ( Figure 4 F). The fact that the correlation was inverse is due to the 60% increase in [3- 13 C]lactate efflux observed in high-grade versus low-grade cancer and benign TSCs, thereby associating with the prevalence of Gleason grade 4 or higher disease. For in vivo studies, the HP [1- 13 C]lactate that effluxes out of the cell will remain predominately in the tumor microenvironment and should add rather than subtract from the HP [1- 13 C]lactate signal, providing a large increase in hyperpolarized lactate with the presence of Gleason grade 4 and 5 cancer. This supposition is consistent with prior studies involving renal cell cancer cells implanted under the renal capsule [ 49 ]. The ability to assess the percentage of Gleason grade 4 and 5 cancer in a tumor has significant implications for selection of the appropriate therapy for patients since cancers with a Gleason score of ≤ 3 + 3 are considered indolent and appropriate for active surveillance while a Gleason score of 7 or higher portends more aggressive cancer. Furthermore, the percentage of Gleason grade 4 present in the cancer impacts risk of progression [ 50 ], i.e., a Gleason score of 3 + 4 has a favorable prognosis with estimated 4-year biochemical recurrence-free survival of 82% compared to 65% for a Gleason score 4 + 3 tumor, which is more similar to the risk for a tumor of Gleason score 4 + 4 [ 51 ].
 P NMR spectra acquired during this prostate TSC bioreactor study demonstrated good TSC viability, as evidenced by good β-NTP levels that did not significantly change over the time-course of the bioreactor studies, consistent with the prior prostate TSC bioreactor study [ 19 ]. The  31 P NMR spectra also demonstrated several pathologic grade-dependent changes that are consistent with prior published studies. There was a significant 3-fold increase in the ratio of the phospholipid metabolites, PC/GPC, between benign TSCs and TSCs with low-grade cancer, and a significant 1.8-fold increase in PC/GPC between low-grade and high-grade cancer. The increase in phospholipid metabolites in PCa relative to benign prostate tissue is consistent with prior in vivo transrectal  31 P MRS studies of the in vivo human prostate [ 33 ]. The cancer grade-dependent increase of PC/GPC in this study was also consistent with a quantitative 1D and 2D  1 H HR-MAS total correlation spectroscopy study of 49 prostate surgical samples that demonstrated that high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3) PCa had significantly higher proliferation (Ki67 labeling) and concentrations of PC and GPC than low-grade cancers [ 52 ]. We also observed a significant 2-fold decrease in the PCr concentration between benign prostate TSCs and TSCs with low-grade cancer, with a further non-significant 1.2-fold reduction of PCr in TSCs with high-grade versus low-grade cancer. A significant reduction in PCr was observed in previous in vivo transrectal  31 P MRS studies of the in vivo human prostate [ 33 ] and in a prior study of PCa TSCs [ 19 ]. The reduction of PCr is consistent with prior studies that revealed that creatine kinase isoenzymes that control the steady state levels of PCr are under hormonal control and are reduced in PCa due to a reduction in androgen sensitivity [ 53 ]. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of  31 P MRS, due to its low gyromagnetic ratio, γ (γ of  31 P ≈ 1/2 that of  1 H), greatly limits its utility in assessing the presence and aggressiveness of prostate tumors in patients. 
The main limitation of this study is that the often small-volume and multifocal nature of PCa, particularly low-grade PCa, did not provide sufficient tissue at surgery to perform all of the necessary studies on the same tissues used in the TSC bioreactor studies. We therefore measured steady state tissue concentrations of lactate in benign, low-, and high- grade PCa from snap-frozen biopsies. Additionally, we did not have sufficient amounts of tissue to measure all of the factors that could lead to increased HP [1- 13 C]lactate in the TSC bioreactor studies. Specifically, increased lactate production in addition to higher LDH activity could also arise from increased pyruvate import via MCT1 and/or increased availability of the cofactor of LDH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). We found that  MCT1  mRNA expression in cancers was two-fold higher than benign tissue similar to a prior study [ 19 ]; however, there was no significant difference between low- and high-grade cancers ( Figure 4 E). Additionally, there was not sufficient tissue to measure NADH. Another limitation is that lactate efflux could not be measured in the bioreactor due to the relatively small amount of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate injected and the large reservoir of perfusion medium. Therefore, lactate efflux was measured with pathologic grade-matched TSCs not used in bioreactor studies in 2-D culture over-time using non-polarized [3- 13 C]pyruvate in the medium.
Notwithstanding these limitations, this study shows that high tissue lactate and rapid lactate efflux are dominant metabolic features of high-grade PCa. Moreover, a number of recent developments support the feasibility of clinically translating these preclinical findings to patient HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate studies. HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate has already been granted FDA approval as an investigational new drug (IND) for use in patients with PCa and has been evaluated in men undergoing a multi-parametric  1 H MRI PCa staging exam [ 54 ]. Based in part on the results of this preclinical prostate TSC study, patient studies have been initiated to investigate the relationship between the apparent rate of HP [1- 13 C]lactate generated from [1- 13 C]pyruvate and cancer grade using whole mount step section pathology after radical prostatectomy as the standard of reference (NCT02526368). One approach for estimating lactate efflux in vivo is based on the concept that the compartmental (intra- versus extra-cellular) difference in mean free diffusion path length would be reflected by the apparent diffusion constant (ADC). While the clinical feasibility of measuring HP lactate ADC is still under development, there are numerous preclinical studies that have shown that it can be measured and used to stratify tumor aggressiveness [ 49 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 ].
