2.1. Gleason Grade-Dependent Increase in Lactate Concentration and LDHA Expression in Snap-Frozen Patient Biopsies
To test the hypothesis that tumor tissue lactate concentrations increase in a Gleason grade-dependent fashion in PCa, lactate concentrations were measured in snap-frozen prostate biopsies using quantitative  1 H HR–MAS NMR spectroscopy. The bar plot shown in  Figure 1 A summarizes the intracellular lactate concentrations in benign (N = 15), low-grade cancer (Gleason score ≤ 3 +4; N = 11), and high-grade cancer (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3; N = 4) biopsies. Steady state lactate concentrations increased from 0.37 ± 0.06 mM in benign tissues to 0.65 ± 0.12 mM in low-grade cancer and 1.5 ± 0.35 mM in high-grade cancer. Intracellular lactate concentrations were significantly different among all three types of tissues. Relative levels of LDHA mRNA expression also significantly differed among the tissues, increasing 1.6-fold in low-grade cancer and 2.5-fold in high-grade cancer compared to benign tissue ( Figure 1 B). The LDH protein is a tetramer comprised of LDH-M and/or LDH-H subunits that are coded by the gene LDHA and LDHB, respectively. Despite the structural similarity, there are subtle differences in the kinetic properties that favor the formation of lactate from pyruvate by the LDH-M subunit and vice versa for the LDH-H subunit. This shift in the LDH isoform composition results in the net increase in tissue lactate concentration. Altogether, these results support the concept of an increase in glycolysis with the transition of benign prostate tissue to cancer and with the progression of cancer from low-risk (Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4) to high-risk (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3).
2.2.  31 P Spectroscopy of TSCs: Tissue Viability and Grade-Dependent  31 P Spectral Changes
Thin, precision-cut slices were prepared from cores of fresh prostate tissue containing no cancer (benign), low-grade cancer (Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4), or high-grade cancer (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3). The tissue slices were cultured overnight on a rotating apparatus in a standard tissue culture incubator prior to placement in a 3-D tissue culture NMR-compatible bioreactor.  Figure 2 A shows representative  31 P spectra from benign, low-grade cancer, and high-grade cancer TSCs in the bioreactor. TSCs were perfused in a gas-equilibrated medium in the bioreactor in order to maintain viability. Both benign and malignant TSCs demonstrated levels of β-NTP indicating good tissue viability, in agreement with the findings from LIVE/DEAD ®  viability/cytotoxicity assays ( Figure S1 ). β-NTP arises from the β phosphate group of the nucleotide triphosphates and provides a measurement of tissue viability [ 32 ]. The measured β-NTP concentrations did not significantly change over the time-course of the bioreactor studies, consistent with the previously established ability of a 10-mm tissue culture bioreactor to maintain prostate TSC viability for up to 24 h [ 19 ]. As seen in the representative  31 P spectra shown in  Figure 2 , the inorganic phosphate resonance (Pi) is dominated by the Pi in the buffer used in the perfusion media negating the ability to measure an intracellular pH. Similar to our findings in previous in vivo [ 33 ] and ex vivo [ 19 ] studies, an increase in the phosphomonoester region of the  31 P spectra and a decrease in phosphocreatine (PCr) in cancer were observed ( Figure 2 A, red dashed lines). Quantitatively, there was a significant ( p  < 0.05) increase in the phosphocholine (PC)/glycerophosphocholine (GPC) ratio between high-grade cancer (3.89 ± 0.89) and low-grade cancer (1.94 ± 0.28) or benign tissue (1.27 ± 0.38) ( Figure 2 B). The concentration of PCr significantly ( p  < 0.005) decreased from 14.4 ± 2.1 nmols in benign tissue to 8.1 ± 0.6 nmols in low-grade cancer and 5.4 ± 0.7 nmols in high-grade cancer ( Figure 2 C). PCr levels were not significantly different between high-grade and low-grade cancer ( p  = 0.359). 
2.3. HP  13 C MRS of TSCs: Gleason Grade-Dependent Increases in HP  13 C Lactate Signal and Efflux
Dynamic data of the conversion of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate to [1- 13 C]lactate with a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were robustly obtained from 60 to 80 mg of prostate TSCs maintained in the 5-mm 3-D tissue culture NMR-compatible bioreactor, with peak HP [1- 13 C]lactate having an average SNR of 13 ± 1. The left side of  Figure 3 A shows a representative spectrum from TSCs containing cancer of Gleason score 3 + 4, acquired at 54 s after infusion of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate at the time of maximum HP [1- 13 C]lactate signal. In tissue culture bioreactor studies, the HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate peak (171 ppm) is very large due to the large volume of medium in the sensitive volume of the coil. Also observed is the [1- 13 C]pyruvate hydrate peak (179.3 ppm) and the natural abundance [2- 12 C]pyruvate peak (206 ppm), which is split into a doublet by the coupling to the  13 C labeled C-1 peak, as well as the metabolic products [1- 13 C]lactate (183.2 ppm) and, in some spectra, the  13 C bicarbonate peak (160.8 ppm). Unfortunately, less than half of the HP  13 C MR spectra contained a quantifiable bicarbonate peak, thereby negating the ability to determine any significant differences in the conversion of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate to [1- 13 C]bicarbonate between the prostate tissue types investigated. On the right side of  Figure 3 A is a stack plot of HP [1- 13 C]lactate over time after injection of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate. Since acquisition is started at time zero, there is a 30-s delay in the arrival of the [1- 13 C]pyruvate ( Figure 3 B) in the sensitive volume of the coil where the tissue chamber is located.  Figure 3 B shows representative dynamic time courses of HP [1- 13 C]lactate signal from benign, low-grade cancer, and high-grade cancer TSCs. At the 3 s temporal resolution of the dynamic HP  13 C MRS acquisition, the time to maximum peak lactate was similar across the different types of prostate tissue and was on average 54 ± 1 s from the time of the first appearance of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate.  Figure 3 C shows the mean HP area under the curve (AUC) Lac/Pyr  for benign prostate tissues (N = 10), low-grade cancer (Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4, N = 19) and high-grade cancer (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3, N = 6). The benign TSCs had the lowest HP AUC Lac/Pyr  (7.81 ± 0.69 × 10 −5 ), with a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the low-grade cancer HP AUC Lac/Pyr  (14.2 ± 1.6 × 10 −5 ) which was not significantly different in high-grade cancer (13.4 ± 3 × 10 −5 ). The lack of increased HP AUC Lac/Pyr  in high-grade cancer is due to increased [3- 13 C]lactate efflux in high-grade PCa, as shown in  Figure 4 , and the subsequent loss of the effluxed HP [1- 13 C]lactate in the perfusion media from the sensitive volume of the RF coil due to the continuous flow conditions employed in the bioreactor experiment, as has been validated in prior studies [ 34 , 35 , 36 ].
Consistent with the significantly increased  LDHA  mRNA expression and tumor tissue lactate concentrations observed in high-grade PCa biopsies ( Figure 1 ),  Figure 4 A shows significantly increased LDH activity in TSCs with high-grade cancer (22.82 ± 5.05 mmols/min/mg) as compared to both benign TSCs (8.49 ± 1.05 mmols/min/mg) and TSCs with low-grade cancer (10.26 ± 2.68 mmols/min/mg). Interestingly, LDH activity was not significantly increased in low-grade cancer compared to benign prostate tissues in this study. The lactate efflux rate of the TSCs is easily measured in the steady state culture conditions using high resolution  1 H NMR of the medium over time, with the addition of [3- 13 C]pyruvate. The pyruvate in the culture medium of the TSCs is taken up and converted to [3- 13 C]lactate and subsequently exported out of the cell, into the medium.  Figure 4 B shows that the lactate efflux rate was significantly increased in TSCs with high-grade cancer (0.100 ± 0.012 μmols/h) compared to benign TSCs (0.07 ± 0.006 μmols/h) and TSCs with low-grade cancer (0.07 ± 0.0002 μmols/h). Similar to LDH activity, lactate efflux rate was not significantly increased in TSCs with low-grade cancer compared to benign TSCs. Expression of transmembrane MCT4, the predominant transporter for lactate efflux from the cell, paralleled the [3- 13 C]lactate efflux rate. TSCs with high-grade cancer had significantly higher MCT4 expression (6 ± 1.4%) than either benign TSCs (2 ± 0.3%) or TSCs with low-grade cancer (2 ± 0.3%) ( Figure 4 C,D). Concurrently while the MCT1 mRNA expression, the gene that encodes for the monocarboxylate transporter predominantly responsible for the uptake of pyruvate, was increased two-fold in PCa compared to the benign TSCs ( Figure 4 E), there was no significant difference between low- and high-grade PCa. Moreover, HP AUC Lac/Pyr  had a significant ( p  = 0.028) inverse correlation (Spearman non-parametric) of r = −0.53 to the percentage of Gleason grade 4 cancer in low-grade cancer slices (primary pattern 3;  Figure 4 F) due to increased lactate efflux out of the cancer cells via the upregulated MCT4 expression with the prevalence of grade 4 disease (N = 17).
In summary, these observations demonstrate that the increased level, as well as efflux, of lactate in high-grade cancers are associated with increased  LDHA  mRNA expression, LDH activity, and MCT4 protein expression, respectively.
