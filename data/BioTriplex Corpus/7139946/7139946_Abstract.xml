Title: Elevated Tumor Lactate and Efflux in High-grade Prostate Cancer demonstrated by Hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Prostate Tissue Slice Cultures.
Abstract: Non-invasive assessment of the biological aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) is needed for men with localized disease. Hyperpolarized (HP)  13 C magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy is a powerful approach to image metabolism, specifically the conversion of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate to [1- 13 C]lactate, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Significant increase in tumor lactate was measured in high-grade PCa relative to benign and low-grade cancer, suggesting that HP  13 C MR could distinguish low-risk (Gleason score ≤3 + 4) from high-risk (Gleason score ≥4 + 3) PCa. To test this and the ability of HP  13 C MR to detect these metabolic changes, we cultured prostate tissues in an MR-compatible bioreactor under continuous perfusion.  31 P spectra demonstrated good viability and dynamic HP  13 C-pyruvate MR demonstrated that high-grade PCa had significantly increased lactate efflux compared to low-grade PCa and benign prostate tissue. These metabolic differences are attributed to significantly increased  LDHA  expression and LDH activity, as well as significantly increased monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) expression in high- versus low- grade PCa. Moreover, lactate efflux, LDH activity, and MCT4 expression were not different between low-grade PCa and benign prostate tissues, indicating that these metabolic alterations are specific for high-grade disease. These distinctive metabolic alterations can be used to differentiate high-grade PCa from low-grade PCa and benign prostate tissues using clinically translatable HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate MR.
