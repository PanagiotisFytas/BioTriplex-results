A pressing need facing the clinical management of men with primary prostate cancer (PCa) is an accurate method for distinguishing indolent from aggressive, potentially lethal, cancer in individual patients [ 1 ]. While the American Cancer Society estimates that 174,650 men will be diagnosed with PCa in the United States in 2019, only 18% (≈31,620) of these patients will have aggressive disease resulting in death due to PCa [ 2 ]. Screening for PCa with a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test has reduced mortality through identification and treatment of high-risk cancer at an earlier time-point, but at the cost of over-diagnosis and over-treatment of low-risk tumors with questionable benefit for many patients [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. This dilemma reflects the biological heterogeneity of PCa and incites efforts to distinguish the small number of patients having aggressive PCa who will benefit from therapeutic intervention and the larger proportion of patients whose tumors are unlikely to progress [ 1 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ]. Proposed solutions to this problem include screening more selectively, reserving treatment for men with aggressive cancer, and guiding those with low-risk/indolent disease to active surveillance, with serial assessment and curative treatment if there is evidence of progression [ 12 , 13 ]. Currently, clinical-pathological-molecular variables including serum PSA levels, biopsy characteristics (Gleason grade, volume of cancer, genetic signatures), and stage of disease all provide important insights into the risk of progression and death [ 14 ], but unfortunately fail to discriminate aggressive versus indolent cancer in many patients. While most patients can live with low-grade PCa throughout their lifespans without treatment, studies have shown that, over time, approximately one-third of these patients will be reclassified with higher-grade cancer and higher risk for progression, and will be subsequently treated [ 15 ]. The current state-of-the-art for imaging localized PCa, multiparametric  1 H magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has demonstrated the ability to localize tumors for subsequent biopsy and treatment, but cannot consistently grade tumor aggressiveness accurately in individual patients [ 16 ]. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for an accurate, non-invasive imaging method to detect aggressive PCa in men at diagnosis and during active surveillance so that timely treatment of this potentially deadly disease can be initiated only when needed.
Increasing evidence points to PCa as a disease strongly linked to abnormal metabolism, and several unique metabolic shifts have been associated with the presence and aggressiveness of PCa [ 17 , 18 , 19 ]. Significant reductions in citrate and polyamines and increased choline metabolites associated with PCa and its progression can be assessed by  1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). However, changes in lactate metabolism that occur in PCa have been largely ignored due to the inability to resolve lactate from lipid in vivo by  1 H MRSI [ 20 ].
Hyperpolarized (HP)  13 C magnetic resonance (MR) is a powerful metabolic imaging method that uses specialized instrumentation to provide signal enhancements of over 10,000-fold for  13 C-enriched, endogenous, non-radioactive compounds [ 21 ]. While the metabolism of PCa is often inadequately evaluated using  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (which assesses glucose uptake and phosphorylation) [ 22 , 23 ], HP  13 C MR detects downstream metabolism, specifically the conversion of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate to [1- 13 C]lactate catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In preclinical studies, this imaging method has shown promise not only for detecting PCa but also for assessing its aggressiveness (pathologic Gleason grade) [ 24 , 25 ]. A single time-point  13 C MRSI study of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate metabolism in the Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model demonstrated a significant increase in HP [1- 13 C]lactate signal in high- versus low-grade prostate tumors [ 24 ]. In a more recent study employing a 3D dynamic dual-agent HP  13 C MRSI approach with [1- 13 C]pyruvate and  13 C urea, a significant increase in the rate of conversion of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate to [1- 13 C]lactate and a significant decrease in  13 C urea perfusion in high- versus low-grade TRAMP tumors were observed [ 25 ]. The conversion of HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate to [1- 13 C]lactate is increased in PCa due in part to genomic loss of the PTEN locus, leading to activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, and amplification of chromosome 8q, including the MYC gene, which occurs in up to 70% and 30% of prostate cancers, respectively [ 26 ]. Additionally, studies have shown that high expression of monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), a lactate exporter essential for maintaining high levels of glycolysis and lactate production [ 27 , 28 ], is associated with more aggressive PCa and therapeutic resistance [ 29 , 30 ].
Unfortunately, murine models do not fully recapitulate the pathologic and biologic heterogeneity of PCa in patients, and therefore the metabolic changes observed with the development of aggressive PCa in the TRAMP model may not fully reflect what will be observed in patients by HP  13 C MRSI. Prior studies have demonstrated that thin, precision-cut slices of prostate tissues obtained at radical prostatectomy and maintained in culture within a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-compatible perfusion system, referred to as a tissue culture bioreactor, can provide a realistic model of the human situation with the structure, function, and metabolism of benign and malignant prostate tissue slice cultures (TSCs) recapitulating observations in patients [ 19 , 31 ]. Specifically, it was shown that malignant TSCs exhibited steady-state glycolytic and phospholipid metabolism and bioenergetics that recapitulated the features of PCa in vivo in patients [ 19 ].
The goal of this study is to provide the first functional evidence in living patient-derived tissues that tumor HP [1- 13 C]lactate and efflux provide accurate measures of PCa aggressiveness/pathologic grade, thereby validating prior animal studies and setting the stage for testing HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate MR imaging in patients to noninvasively assess disease aggressiveness. This was accomplished using a combination of quantitative  1 H high resolution–magic angle spinning (HR–MAS) NMR of snap-frozen patient biopsies, and HP  13 C NMR studies of living human prostate tissues obtained at surgery and maintained in an NMR-compatible three-dimensional (3D) tissue culture bioreactor [ 19 ].
