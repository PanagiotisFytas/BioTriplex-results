Subjects
The Ethical Committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences has confirmed the study protocol (IR.SBMU.MSP.REC.1400.620). All enrolled cases and controls signed the written informed consent. Blood samples of 50 type I BD patients and 50 normal subjects were collected from Imam Hussein hospital during 2016–2019. Cases were recruited consecutively from Imam Hossein hospital during the study period and were examined in this hospital. BD cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 21 . Moreover, depressive and mania symptoms and the presence of euthymia were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) 22  and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) 23 . Patients were also assessed using a semi-structured interview which was based on asking questions within a prearranged thematic structure by skilled specialists who were trained through passing relevant courses. Clinical data including disease duration/ onset and drug history were collected. All recruited patients were not responsive to first-line mood stabilizers and took standard dose of Carbamazepine (200 mg, 2 times a day). In fact, most of patients who were not responsive to the first-line mood stabilizers in the mentioned clinic were under treatment with carbamazepine. So, in order to have a homogenized cohort of patients, we just included these patients. With the purpose of decreasing heterogeneity of the patients’ cohort, cases who took other drugs were excluded. History of head trauma, encephalitis or other mental illnesses and systemic disorders were regarded as exclusion criteria. Control subjects were assessed by a specialist to rule out the presence of signs or symptoms related with psychiatric disorders.
Sample collection and RNA extraction
Five ml of peripheral blood was collected from all cases and controls. Total RNA was extracted from blood samples using RNX kit (EX6101, Cinnagen, Tehran, Iran). Extracted RNA was assessed using gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometer.
cDNA production and real-time PCR assay
cDNA was made using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), based on the Company's comments. Expression levels of  ANRIL ,  CEBPA-DT ,  H19 ,  NKILA  and  HNF1A-AS1  were enumerated in comparison with  beta 2 microglubolin  ( B2M ) as an internal control using self-designed primers which were similar to our previous study 24 . qRT-PCR was implemented in the ABI 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA) using BIOFACT™ 2X Real-Time PCR Master Mix. All experiments were conducted in duplicate. Table  1  shows the primer sequences. Primers were synthetized by Macrogen Company (Seoul, Korea). Transcripts were enumerated using the comparative –delta Ct method. The primers were designed to amplify 14 isoforms of  ANRIL  and 3 isoforms of  H19 . For other lncRNAs, only one isoform was amplified by designed primers. Table 1 Information about primers and the amplified transcripts.

Statistical methods
GraphPad Prism version 9.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis. We compared expression levels of five lncRNA genes, namely  ANRIL ,  CEBPA-DT ,  H19 ,  NKILA  and  HNF1A-AS1  in blood samples obtained from BD patients and controls. Normal/Gaussian distribution of the values was evaluated using the Shapiro–wilk test. As data was not normally distributed, we used the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test to detect differentially expressed transcripts between cases and controls. Two-way ANOVA test and Tukey post hoc test (as a complementary test for ANOVA test) were used for assessment of the effect of disease and gender on expression of genes and their interactions.
Correlations between gene expression levels of lncRNAs were measured with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient as data was not normally distributed. In addition, correlations between gene expression levels and age, disease duration, sex and age at onset were measured using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were illustrated to judge the diagnostic power of expression levels of differentially expressed lncRNAs.  P  value < 0.05 was considered as significant.
Ethical approval and consent to participant
