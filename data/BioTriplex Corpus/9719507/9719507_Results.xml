General information about cases and controls
Table  2  shows age, sex ratio and other available information about enrolled persons. There was no significant difference in age between cases and controls ( P  value = 0.11). Table 2 General data of cases and controls. Study group Parameters Values Patients Sex (number) Male 35 Female 15 Age (Years, mean ± SD) Male 38.48 ± 9.33 Female 31.87 ± 7.73 Duration (Years, mean ± SD) Male 4.25 ± 2.77 Female 2.86 ± 2.16 Age of onset (Years, mean ± SD) Male 34.2 ± 8.21 Female 29 ± 6.49 Controls Sex (number) Male 35 Female 15 Age (Years, mean ± SD) Male 33.25 ± 8.84 Female 34.46 ± 8.21
Expression assays
Since we hypothesized that expression of NF-ƙB-related lncRNAs would be different among BD patients and controls, we assessed their expression in the peripheral blood of both study groups using real time PCR method. Figure  1  shows the corresponding band to the assessed lncRNAs as well as the housekeeping gene after RT-PCR. Figure 1 HNF1A-AS1 ,  NKILA ,  ANRIL ,  CEBPA-DT  ( ADINR ),  H19  and  B2M , respectively. RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel. Lanes 1–7 are 50 bp ladder, 
We detected significant difference in expression of  ANRIL ,  CEBPA-DT  ( ADINR ),  NKILA  and  HNF1A-AS1  between BD patients and controls (Fig.  2 ). Figure 2 A – E ).—delta Ct values were plotted as box and whisker plots showing median, mean, interquartile range, and minimum and maximum values. Mann–Whitney U test was used to detect differentially expressed genes between cases and controls (** P  value < 0.01 and **** P  value < 0.0001). Relative expression levels of five lncRNAs in bipolar disorder (BD) patients (total) and healthy controls (total) as described by –delta Ct values (
Group (disease) factor had significant effect on expression levels of  ANRIL ,  CEBPA-DT ,  HNF1-AS1  and  NKILA . However, neither gender factor nor interaction of gender and group has significant effects on expression levels of studied gene; therefore, we did not perform post hoc tests for multiple comparisons (Table  3 ). Table 3 Graphpad prism output from showing the effects of Group and Gender (Tests of Between-Subjects Effects) on levels of lncRNAs in cases compared to healthy controls.

While  ANRIL ,  CEBPA-DT  and  HNF1A-AS1  were significantly under-expressed in BD patients compared with controls,  NKILA  levels were higher in patients versus controls.
In order to assess possible relation between expressions of mentioned lncRNAs, we performed correlation analysis in each study subgroup. We detected significant pairwise correlation between all lncRNA pairs among BD patients and healthy controls (Table  4 ). Table 4 N  = 50) and healthy controls ( N  = 50). Spearman’s correlation between RNA expression levels among BD patients ( CEBPA-DT H19 NKILA HNF1A-AS1 Cases Controls Cases Controls Cases Controls Cases Controls ANRIL 0.3* 0.7** 0.37* 0.42* 0.25 0.59** 0.3* 0.5** CEBPA-DT 0.57** 0.63** 0.59** 0.77* 0.3* 0.65** H19 0.55** 0.55** 0.53** 0.53** NKILA 0.46** 0.73** p  < 0.05. * p  < 0.001. **
In order to assess the possibility of using expression levels of mentioned lncRNAs as diagnostic markers in BD, we assessed their diagnostic power using ROC curve analysis. Among differentially expressed genes,  HFN1A-AS1  exhibited the best diagnostic parameters in separation of patients from controls (AUC ± SD = 0.86 ± 0.03, sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.82,  P  value < 0.0001). AUC values for  NKILA ,  ANRIL  and  CEBPA-DT  were 0.71, 0.68 and 0.65, respectively (Fig.  3  and Table  5 ). Figure 3 ROC curves of transcript levels of five lncRNAs in patients with bipolar disorder. Table 5 ROC curve analysis for 4 differentially expressed lncRNAs in patients with BD disorder.

Finally, we checked whether expression of mentioned lncRNAs is different between male and female subgroups or whether their expression is correlated with demographic/clinical parameter. In spite of significant difference in expression of four lncRNAs between cases and controls, expression levels of none of lncRNAs were correlated with clinical/demographic parameters (Table  6 ).
