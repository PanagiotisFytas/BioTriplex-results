Catatonia as a clinical syndrome is an elusive entity. PML in AIDS which presents exclusively as catatonia raises crucial concerns about diagnostic conceptualization and serious lapses in investigation of such patients, as well as risk management of caregivers and hospital staff.
HIV infection in this patient presented solely as PML with no identifiable clinical evidence of immunosuppression. The CD4+ T helper cell count of 339 cells/cmm (normal range 337–1690 cells/cmm) further confirms relatively good immunological competence. Only 6% of patients with PML without immunocompromised status have been reported. However, these were all anecdotal reports. 2  There is conflicting evidence as to whether JC viral DNA is present within the brain of non-immunocompromised patients. 1  However, the development of so-called ‘primary’ PML in patients without immunosuppression would suggest that the virus may lie dormant within the nervous system. 1  Irrespective of the immune status, the JC virus remains latent in the kidney and may be detected in the urine. Whether PML results from reactivation of latent virus in the brain or due to haematogenous spread is yet unclear. Pathological findings in favour of haematogenous spread point towards the predilection of PML for the grey/white interface around the end arterioles. 1  The present case report highlights the need for further exploration to unravel this yet unresolved issue.
PML that presents as a psychotic state with predominantly negative symptoms which develop in a subacute manner, and run a protracted course, ultimately blend with catatonia in the absence of other neurological signs such as overt dementia, motor function abnormalities, cranial nerve palsies may well camouflaged with functional catatonia. Catatonia, the term used by Karl Kahlbaum, 1863 3  is often an intricate neurobehavioural syndrome with diverse primary functional (affective disorder, schizophrenia) and secondary organic causes. It is frequently encountered in general medical and psychiatric wards. The index case also had a triad of mutism, akinesia or severe hypokinesia and catalepsy which fulfilled the criteria of catatonia.
It was the late onset emergence of the frontal grasp, rooting and glabellar tap reflexes which pointed towards underlying focal cerebral damage and enabled us to precisely predict the impending right hemiplegia and double incontinence that developed in 3 weeks. The term ‘akinetic mutism’ as coined by Cairns  et al . 4  has two crucial diagnostic factors 5 —first, a seeming wakefulness without recognizable content and, second, a relative paucity of signs implying significant damage to the descending motor pathways, which explain the immobile state. The present case had immobility and mutism, which were not based on a primary motor disturbance but the evidence of focal cerebral damage allowed it to be classified as akinetic mutism and more precisely as ‘frontal-akinetic mutism’. 6  The possibility of ‘locked-in syndrome’ was ruled out as the majority of the descending motor pathways to the spinal cord and lower cranial nerve motor nuclei were intact, and mutism was associated with spontaneous motor move-ments. The condition therefore fulfils the criteria for the syndromic diagnosis of catatonia followed by akinetic mutism. Catatonia in this case may represent early neurotransmitter dysfunction, affecting areas where structural damage could induce akinetic mutism. Core cognitive deficits in negative schizophrenia, particularly in the area of executive function and working memory, have been emphasized by recent investigators. 7  Hairline differences among various clinical syndromes of functional and/or organic CNS origin involving the fronto-limbic-striatal circuitry 8  as a common pathway could easily be missed during cursory physical and neuro-psychiatric evaluation, and may be of great clinical relevance in a sensitive disease such as AIDS.
MRI facilities in India are few, especially in government medical colleges. It seems the mainstay of diagnosis of PML as antemortem brain biopsy is not feasible. The cost of MRI compared with CT scan is yet another limiting factor for the diagnosis of such cases. The deceptive role of CT scan in diagnosing such demyelinating disorders is obvious ( Fig 1 ). Delayed identification of such cases of PML in AIDS not only deprives them of prompt management with antiretroviral therapy but also poses a risk to caregivers, including therapists. It is strongly recommended that all patients presenting with catatonia/akinetic mutism, particularly those belonging to a high-risk group for AIDS, must be routinely screened for HIV and subjected to MRI of the brain.
