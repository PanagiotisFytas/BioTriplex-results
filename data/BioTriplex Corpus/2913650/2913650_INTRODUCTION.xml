Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare demyelinating disorder caused by the opportunistic JC papovavirus. It is an occasional complication of chronic diseases affecting the reticulo-endothelial system such as lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, leukaemia, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis; patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy in malignancy and post-organ transplantation, and in AIDS. HIV-associated cases account for up to 85% of all cases of PML 1  and there is a likelihood of further increase with the rising trend in AIDS. A case of PML associated with AIDS is described with clinical features of psychoticism with negative features leading to catatonia and eventually akinetic mutism without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state.
