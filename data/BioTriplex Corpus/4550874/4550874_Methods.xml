Animals
Age matched WT, mdx, and mdx:utr male and female mice were analyzed at time points of 2, 4, 8, and 12 months. WT (C57BL/10J) and mdx (C57BL/10ScSn-Dmd mdx /J) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. mdx:utr mice were generated by crossing mdx:utr(+/−) heterozygotes, a gift from Dr. Robert Grange (Virginia Tech), from a line originally derived and obtained from Drs. Mark Grady and Joshua Sanes (Washington University) 34 . Genotyping was performed using previously published sequences 45 . As mdx:utr mice on average do not survive later than 3–4 months of age, these mice were only analyzed up to the 4 month time point. No significant differences were found between sexes in remodeling or in response to peptide mimetic treatment. All animal experiments were approved by the IACUC of Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.
Human Samples
Two non-DMD and two DMD male human heart samples were obtained from the University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank, a member of the NIH NeuroBioBank network. All samples were dissected post-mortem. DMD1 cause of death was attributable to cardiac failure at age 15 while DMD2 cause of death was attributed to pulmonary thromboembolism at age 17. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects from whom tissues were analyzed. All human experiments were approved by the IRB of Rutgers University and performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.
Immunofluorescence
Hearts from WT, mdx, and mdx:utr mice were dissected out, rinsed in sterile PBS, and frozen in O.C.T. using liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane. Human DMD heart samples were similarly frozen in O.C.T. using liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane. Cryosections were cut at 6 μm and stained with an antibody reactive to Cx43 (anti-mouse, Sigma, C8093, 1:500) along with a counterstain of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, Invitrogen, 1:1000) to demarcate cell borders or N-cadherin (anti-rat DSHB, MNCD2, 1:20). Slides were coverslipped with a mounting medium containing DAPI and sections were imaged and analyzed using a Nikon A1R confocal (60 × objective,  Fig. 1 ) or Eclipse T1 (40 × objective,  Fig. 2 ) microscope and NIS-Elements AR software.
Western Blotting
Hearts from WT, mdx, and mdx:utr mice were dissected out, rinsed in sterile PBS, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Mouse tissues were homogenized in M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce) supplemented with EDTA, PMSF, NaVO 3 , Okadaic Acid, NaF, Benzamidine, and NaPyr. Human tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5% glycerol) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche, cOmplete ULTRA Mini and PhosSTOP). Western blots performed without the use of proper phosphatase inhibitors yield a single band for Cx43 migrating near 43 kda, rather than separate np-Cx43 and p-Cx43 bands. Protein concentrations were estimated using a BCA kit (Pierce). 5 μg of protein per sample was separated on 12% gels (Bio-Rad) and run under the same experimental conditions, transferred to PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the following antibodies: Cx43 (Sigma, C8093, 1:8000), GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 3683, 1:2000), Panx1 (Santa Cruz, sc49695, 1:1000) or Na v 1.5 (Sigma, S0819, 1:500). Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and densitometric analysis was performed using Fuji Images or Bio-Rad Image Lab software.
Electrocardiography
Whole animal electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded using needle electrodes in a Lead II configuration. Animals were anesthetized by Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, 290 mg/kg IP) and kept at a constant 37° temperature using a heating pad for the duration of analysis. ECG signals were acquired using a DSI Ponemah amplifier and pClamp Axoscope 10 software (Molecular Devices.) Following baseline reading, animals were treated for 20 minutes with the Connexin 43 mimetic peptide 43-Gap 26 (Anaspec, Sequence: VCYDKSFPISHVR, 1 ug/kg IV) or Gap 19 (Custom synthesized, Sequence: KQIEIKKFK, 10 ug/kg IV) via retro orbital injection. The sequence of Gap 26 corresponds to that of the first extracellular loop of Cx43 and inhibits the interaction between it and an adjacent Cx43 protein. The sequence of Gap 19 corresponds to that of the intracellular cytoplasmic loop of Cx43 and inhibits the interaction between it and the Cx43 C-terminus, which is required for hemichannel opening 21 27 28 . Negative control animals were treated for the same duration with a Pannexin-1 mimetic peptide (Anaspec, Sequence: WRQAAFVDSY, 10 ug/kg or 100 ug/kg IV) or a similar volume of saline. Following treatment time, mice were challenged by isoproterenol (Iso, Sigma, 5 mg/kg IP) and ECGs were constantly recorded. Arrhythmias were scored based on a point system where: 0 = no arrhythmias, 1 = single premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), 2 = double PVCs, 3 = non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), 4 = sustained VT or atrioventricular (AV) block, and 5 = death. ECG parameters including RR, QRS, and QT intervals were measured at a significant number of randomly selected points to obtain representative values.
Statistics
Data was evaluated for statistical significance using parametric analysis in GraphPad Prism or SigmaPlot software (ANOVA in the case of three groups or paired T-tests in the case of two groups) and expressed as mean ± SEM. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
