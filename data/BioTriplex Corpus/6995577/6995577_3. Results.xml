3.1. BME Prevented TTR Amyloid Fibril Formation
Amyloidogenesis and fibril formation by TTR is closely associated with the development of the devastating clinical features that characterize ATTR amyloidosis. In order to determine whether BME is able to modulate TTR amyloidogenesis, we accessed its effect on human TTR fibrillation in vitro using acid-mediated aggregation and fibril formation assay. In vitro, human TTR is capable of forming mature amyloid fibrils under mildly acidic conditions at a temperature of 37 °C. As revealed by the TEM image in  Figure 1 A, human TTR did not only form amorphous aggregates, but also formed mature amyloid fibrils after incubation for 14 days in the absence of BME ( Figure 1 B). Notably, in the presence of 20 µg/µL BME (concentration of human TTR was 1 µg/µL) no oligomers nor fibrils were observed as shown in  Figure 1 B. From these results, it can be inferred that BME inhibited human TTR aggregation and fibril formation.
3.2. Effect of Native TTR Stability under Urea-Induced Denaturation Stress
Since tetramer dissociation into monomers is the required and rate-limiting step in TTR amyloidogenesis we speculated that BME might have an effect on native TTR dissociation given its inhibition of fibril formation. Thus, we determined the effect of BME on human TTR and L55P TTR resistance to urea-mediated denaturation stress as described in the Materials section. As shown in  Figure 2 A (and its representative Tricine-SDS-PAGE image,  Figure 2 C), in the absence, but not in the presence of BME, human TTR was substantially dissociated after 72 h of incubation in 6 M urea at 4 °C. The percent of folded human TTR (i.e., tetramers, trimers and dimers) left after denaturation stress was higher in the presence of 13.33 µg/µL BME (106 ± 4.77) compared to in its absence (73.49 ± 2.06). Quantitatively the percentage of folded human TTR left after denaturation in BME was not different from that of the control. Correspondingly, there was no formation of human TTR monomers in the presence but not in the absence of BME as indicated by the lack of appearance of the 16 kDa protein band on the gel ( Figure 2 C). The same trend of results was observed when L55P TTR was subjected to urea mediated denaturation with or without 13.33 µg/µL BME ( Figure 2 B,C), however, dissociation of L55P TTR was not completely abrogated by BME as indicated by the presence of protein bands around 14–20 kDa corresponding to monomers. These results thus suggest that BME mitigated the dissociation of both human TTR and L55P TTR into monomers.
3.3. Effect of Human TTR Tetramer Stability under Mildly Acidic Denaturation Condition
TTR undergoes amyloidogenesis in vitro under mildly acid pH. However, this process requires the dissociation of native TTR tetramers into monomers which are susceptible to amyloidogenic transformation by partial unfolding. To ascertain the effect of BME on human TTR stability under acid-mediated denaturation conditions, the amount of tetramer left after aging the protein for 14 days with or without BME was quantified as described in above. As shown in  Figure 3 , incubation of human TTR under mild acidity markedly reduced the percentage of tetramers in the absence but not in the presence of 20 µg/µL BME. Correspondingly, the content of monomers produced due to acid mediated denaturation of human TTR was higher in the absence than in the presence of BME as revealed by the monomer band intensity ( Figure 3 B). These results suggest that BME mitigated human TTR tetramer dissociation under mildly acidic conditions and further supports the earlier results observed under urea mediated denaturation conditions.
3.4. Impact of BME on TTR Quaternary Structural Stability and Dose-Dependent Effect
As earlier stated, the key to TTR amyloidogenesis is its transition from tetramer to monomer, thus the stability of the native tetramer is crucial in mitigating its amyloidogenesis. To determine the effect of BME on the quaternary structural stability of human TTR, the protein solution with or without the extract was subjected to urea mediated denaturation stress followed by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay gives a reflection of the protein in its different conformations upon resolving on Tricine-SDS-PAGE [ 25 ]. As shown in  Figure 4 , the human TTR solution with or without BME after denaturation stress contained tetramers, trimers, dimers, and monomers, albeit in different proportions. In both the acid and urea mediated denaturation conditions ( Figure 4 A,B, respectively), the proportion of human TTR tetramer left at the end of the denaturation stress was greater in the presence than in the absence of BME as indicated by the protein band intensities. The opposite was reflected with regards to the proportion of monomers left, especially in the case of urea mediated denaturation ( Figure 4 B). However, based on the protein band intensities, the content of monomers left after acid mediated denaturation appear to be lesser in the absence of BME. Presumably, this may be due to their rapid conversion to amyloid competent species that are rapidly transformed into higher molecular weight aggregates and fibrils [ 26 ] as earlier shown in  Figure 1 . Thus, it is possible to deduce from these results that BME resisted the dissociation of TTR tetramer to monomers under tetramer-dissociating acid and urea mediated denaturation stress conditions.
The dose-dependent effect of BME on human TTR stability was determined by varying the concentrations of the extract in human TTR denaturation solution. As shown in  Figure 4 C, there was a substantially higher percentage of human TTR tetramers left after denaturation stress in the presence and not the absence of BME. However, the increase in the amount of human TTR in the presence of increasing amounts of BME was not remarkably different. These observations may be due to fact that the bioactive ligands responsible for tetramer stability was already saturated in its interactions with human TTR at every concentration of BME tested. These results thus seem to suggest that it is possible for BME to stabilize human TTR tetramer.
3.5. Determination of Human TTR Amyloid Fibril Disrupting Activity of BME
In order to ascertain whether BME had any effect on already formed human TTR amyloid fibril, the soluble protein was first converted into mature fibrils by aging for 14 days in 200 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0 at 37 °C. Formation of mature human TTR amyloid fibrils was confirmed using TEM. The preformed human TTR fibrils was the co-incubated with or without BME at 37 °C for an additional 24 h. Thereafter, aliquot of the fibril solution was obtained and diluted by 100 times with Milli-Q water and spotted on formvar coated copper TEM grid followed by negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were later obtained. From the TEM images obtained ( Figure 5 ), it could be seen that the presence of BME did not alter the fibril morphology. There was no disruption in the mature preformed human TTR fibrils after 24 h of incubation of the given concentration of BME. Thus, it can be concluded that BME did not possess any fibril disrupting activity on mature human TTR fibrils.
3.6. Determination of BME Binding to TTR
Binding interaction between BME and human TTR was monitored using the small fluorescent probe ANS. ANS is very sensitive to the polarity of its environment. In aqueous environments, ANS has a weak fluorescence and displays an emission of maximum at 500 nm. Upon binding to the hydrophobic patches of proteins it produces a blue shift in its emission wavelength and an increase in its fluorescence intensity the extent of which is dependent on the protein structure and milieu surrounding ANS [ 27 ]. In the presence of human TTR tetramer, ANS binds specifically to the thyroxine-binding sites within the hydrophobic cavity with a consequent increase in fluorescence intensity at about 480 nm [ 28 ]. As shown in  Figure 6 , human TTR and ANS separately in phosphate buffer had very weak fluorescence intensities. However, upon co-incubation of human TTR and ANS in phosphate buffer, there was a dramatic increase in the fluorescence intensity. This can be attributed to the binding of ANS to the thyroxine-binding sites of human TTR tetramers as previously reported [ 7 , 28 ]. Interestingly, introduction of BME reduced the ANS fluorescence intensities dose-responsively. These seem to suggest that BME binds to the thyroxine binding sites of the tetramers and prevents ANS from its preferred binding location on the protein. Out of the hydrophobic T4-binding sites, ANS thus gives reduced fluorescence intensity.
3.7. Chemical Characterization of BME
The major bioactive phytoconstituents in BME were determined by RP-HPC quantitative analysis as described in the Methods section. BME was found to contain Bacoside A (Bacoside A3 (2.22%  w / w ), Bacopaside II (4.68%  w / w ), Bacopaside X (3.25%  w / w )) and Bacopaside I (3.54%  w / w ), giving a total saponin content of 16.03%  w / w  of dried extract. Previously it had been reported that the total Bacoside A content of methanol extract of in vitro culture of  Bacopa monnieri  was 8.73 mg/g of dry weight [ 29 ]. The superior content of BME may be due to difference in our extraction method and solvent composition. BME contain over sixty individual compounds. The metabolite profile of saponins, phenolics, and other components present were previously determined by LC-ESI-qTOF-MS [ 15 ]. The total phenolic content of BME was also determined using the widely accepted Folin–Ciocalteu assay. BME recorded a phenolic content of 26.45 mg gallic acid equivalent/gram of dry weight. Compared to the phenolic content of thirty common culinary herbs in Thailand previously reported, BME had a higher phenolic content than twenty-three of them including  Cucurbita moschata  (pumpkin) leaves,  Allium sativum  (garlic) cloves,  Mentha canalenisa  (peppermint) leaves,  Curcuma longa  (turmeric) rhizome. However, the phenolic content of  Ocimum basilicum  (sweet basil) leaves,  Ocimum sanctum  (holy basil) leaves and  Acacia pennet a (acacia) shoot tips were higher than BME. Given that flavonoids constitute a major proportion of polyphenols in several plant species, the total flavonoid content in BME was determined and found to be 17.6 mg quercetin equivalent/g of BME [ 30 ].
The antioxidant capacity of BME was determined using DPPH and FRAP assays, two of the most commonly reported in vitro methods for ascertaining antioxidant content in fruits, vegetables, and plant-derived constituents. The FRAP assay measures the reductive ability of all the redox-active constituents in BME via single electron transfer (SET) mechanism while the DPPH assay determines radical scavenging activity of the extract toward the DPPH radical by SET and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms [ 31 ]. As shown in  Table 1 , BME had a FRAP value of 306.82 µmol Fe(II)/g, which is indicative of its ability to reduce ferric-TPTZ complex to its ferrous form. The DPPH IC 50  value for BME was 90.89 mg/L. Konczak et al. observed a high degree of correlation between the FRAP value (in µmol Fe(II)/g dry weight) of commercially grown native Australian herbs and spices and their phenolic content (in mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight), which validated the notion that antioxidant capacity of bioactive components from food and plants is a function of their natural phenolic content [ 32 ]. Given that many of the health benefits associated with the consumption of fruits, vegetables and bioactives from plant sources have been attributed to antioxidants, it can be speculated that the presence these small-molecule natural antioxidant phenolics and saponins might be responsible for the anti-amyloidogenic properties of BME.
