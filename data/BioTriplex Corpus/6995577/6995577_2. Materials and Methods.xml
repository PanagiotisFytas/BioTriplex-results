2.1. Expression and Purification of Recombinant L55P TTR
Recombinant L55P TTR was produced in  Pichia pastoris  expression system as described earlier [ 16 ]. L55P TTR was purified from the concentrated culture supernatant using preparative discontinuous native-PAGE. Silver staining was used to determine fractions containing only L55P TTR, which were subsequently pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Concentration of the purified L55P TTR was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Pure L55P TTR was stored at −20 °C until use.
2.2. Purification of Human TTR from Plasma
Human plasma was pretreated by reduction of albumin via adsorption in a Cibacron blue 3GA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) column. The unbound faction was concentrated by ultrafiltration. Human TTR was purified from the concentrated, pretreated human plasma by preparative discontinuous native-PAGE using BIO-RAD Model 491 Prep Cell system (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA) as described previously [ 17 ].
2.3. Plant Material Collection and Preparation of B. monnieri Extract (BME)
Fresh Brahmi was obtained from Naresuan University. Whole plant specimen was identified and authenticated by Dr. Pranee Nangngam with voucher specimen (Saesong004) deposited at the Herbarium of the Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Naresuan University, Thailand. Brahmi aerial parts of about 10 cm was washed and dried for 24 h at 50 °C in a hot air oven. The dried plant material was then blended into powder. Brahmi powder was extracted as earlier reported [ 15 ]. Briefly, pre-soaked plant material was extracted with 95 % ethanol (solid solvent ratio of 1:6  w / v ) by sonicating for 10 min. The residue was further extracted two more times. The ethanolic extracts were combined, filtered and evaporated to obtain  Bacopa monnieri  or Brahmi extract (BME).
2.4. Chemical Characterization of Brahmi Extract

           2.4.1. RP-HPLC Quantitative Analysis 
           B. monnieri , thus the saponin content of Brahmi was quantified using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography as previously reported [ 18 ]. Five individual saponins standards, including Bacoside A3, Bacopaside I, Bacopaside II, Bacopaside X, and Bacopopasaposin C were used. Total saponin content was obtained as the sum of the individual saponin and expressed as the percentage weight of the dried extract. It has been widely reported that saponins constitute the major bioactive components in  
        

           2.4.2. Total Phenolic Content 
           19 ]. BME or gallic acid (standard) was solubilized in DMSO: methanol (10:90  v / v ). One hundred microliters of BME, standard or blank was added into test tube followed by freshly prepared 10 % Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (200 µL). For the blank, 200 µL of distilled water was added in place of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent. Five minutes later, 700 mM sodium carbonate solution (800 µL) was added to develop a blue mixture. The solutions were incubated in the dark for 2 h at room temperature. Absorbance was read at 765 nm and a standard curve was plotted from gallic acid (0–0.05 mg). Total phenolic content of BME was obtained from the standard curve and expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent per gram of Brahmi extract dry weight. The content of phenolic compounds in BME was determined by Folin–Ciocalteu as previously described [ 
        

           2.4.3. Total Flavonoid Content 
           19 ]. One hundred and eighty microliters of BME, quercetin (standard) or blank solubilized in DMSO: methanol (1:5  v / v ) was introduced to test tubes. Methanolic aluminum chloride 10%  w / v  (30 µL) was added into the solution. Methanol was added to the blank instead of AlCl 3 . Subsequently, 1 M sodium acetate (30 µL) and distilled water (850 µL) were added to the mixture and vortexed. Due to the deep coloration of the extract, a blank for the extract was prepared containing all the components but with methanol instead of methanolic AlCl 3  solution. The sample, standard and blank solutions were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Absorbance was recorded at 415 nm. A standard curve was plotted from quercetin (0–0.05 mg). The total flavonoid content of Brahmi extract was derived from the standard curve and expressed as mg quercetin equivalent per gram of Brahmi extract dry weight. Content of flavonoid compounds was determined by aluminum chloride colorimetric assay as previously described [ 
        

           2.4.4. Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) Assay 
           20 ] with slight modifications. Freshly prepared FRAP solution (300 mM acetate buffer pH 3.6, 10 mM 2,4,6-Tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine) solution, 20 mM FeCl 3 ·6H 2 O) was warmed for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. BME was solubilized in 50% DMSO while ferrous sulfate (0–2 mM) was prepared as standard for calibration. BME or ferrous sulfate solution (10 µL) was added in a 96-well microplate followed by FRAP solution (200 µL). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. Absorbance was read at a wavelength of 593 nm. FRAP values were obtained from a calibration curve prepared using ferrous sulfate and expressed as mmol ferrous equivalent per gram of Brahmi extract dry weight. The antioxidant capacity of Brahmi extract was obtained using FRAP assay as described by Benzie and Strain [ 
        

           2.4.5. DPPH Radical Scavenging Assay 
           21 ]. Ten microliters of plant extract solution (8.33–166.67 mg/L) was added into the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Methanol (140 µL) followed by 0.1 mM DPPH (150 µL) in methanol were added to the extract. Methanol without the extract served as control while corresponding blank probes contained 10 µL of extract and 290 µL of methanol. After 30 min of incubation, absorbance was read at 515 nm and the DPPH radical scavenging effect of BME was expressed as IC 50 , i.e., the extract concentration that inhibited DPPH radical formation by 50%. The anti-radical activity of BME was determined by DPPH assay as described by Lesjak et al. [ 
        
2.5. Transthyretin Tetramer Stabilization Assays

           2.5.1. Urea-Mediated Denaturation Assay 
           The effect of BME on human TTR or L55P TTR tetramer stability was determined using urea-mediated denaturation assay. The protein was pre-incubated with BME, curcumin or DMSO (solvent) for 4 h at 37 °C in the dark. Urea solution was added to the protein solution (at a final concentration of 6 M) to initiate dissociation of the tetramers. Protein solution was incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 72 h. Thereafter, the amount of folded L55P TTR (i.e., dimers, trimmers, and tetramers) left was obtained by resolving the protein solution on 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE gel followed by densitometric analysis on LabWorks 4.0 software (UVP Ltd., Cambridge, UK) of the Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, stained protein bands on the gels. 
        

           2.5.2. Acid-Mediated Denaturation Assay 
           22 ]. The fraction of human TTR tetramers left after subjection to mild acid denaturation stress was quantified from the gel band intensities via densitometric analysis using gel documentation. Human TTR solution with or without BME was pre-incubated for 4 h to enable binding interactions. Thereafter, protein solutions were subjected to denaturation by addition of acetate buffer, pH 4.0 and incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 14 days. To determine the extent of denaturation, protein solutions were solubilized in SDS sample loading buffer without β-mercaptoethanol (i.e., 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.1% bromophenol blue dye). Protein samples (without boiling) were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS and separated bands were detected with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 staining. In principle, under this SDS-PAGE condition, tetrameric transthyretin will be observed as SDS-resistant dimers on the gel [ 
        
2.6. Transthyretin pH-Induced Fibril Formation and Disruption Assays
The effect of BME on human TTR aggregation and fibril formation was determined by pre-incubating human TTR for 4 h with or without BME at 37 °C. Thereafter, the pH was adjusted to 4.0 with 200 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Aggregation of human TTR was enabled by aging the protein complex for 14 days in the dark at 37 °C under aseptic conditions. The extent of protein aggregation and fibrillation were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For TEM analysis, a drop of protein solution was spotted unto a formvar-coated copper grid for 3 min. Excess fluid was carefully blotted with a filter paper wedge. The grid was then rinsed with a drop of Milli-Q water (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) followed by staining with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% methanol for 2 min. The grid was further rinsed with a drop of Milli-Q, excess fluid blotted away and dried at ambient temperature. The TEM image was obtained using a JEOL JEM-2010 (JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) electron microscope operating at 160 kV. The fibril disruption assay was performed as previously described [ 6 ]. Preformed fibrils were prepared using acid-mediated aggregation assay and formation of fibrils was confirmed by TEM. The pre-formed fibrils were further incubated with or without BME in the dark at 37 °C for 24 h. Thereafter, fibril disruption activity was confirmed by TEM and glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay followed by 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE.
2.7. Transthyretin Quaternary Structural Alterations Determined by Glutaraldehyde Cross-Linking Assay
The quaternary structure of human TTR or L55P TTR subjected to urea-induced denaturation or human TTR after acid-mediated denaturation stress was determined by chemical cross-linking assay using glutaraldehyde. Aliquot of protein solution was obtained denaturation at stress. Glutaraldehyde was added to the protein solution (final concentration of 2.5%) and cross-linking allowed for 4 min at ambient temperature. Cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of 7% NaBH 4  in 0.1 M NaOH (of equal volume to glutaraldehyde). The mixture was solubilized with 4× SDS sample loading buffer (final SDS concentration of 2%) and boiled for 10 min before resolving on 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel. Protein bands were detected using Coomassie brilliant blue staining.
2.8. Determination of Inhibitor Binding by ANS Displacement Fluorescence Assay
The small fluorescent probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS), is widely used in monitoring ligand or inhibitor binding to the thyroxine-binding site of native tetrameric TTR [ 23 ]. ANS binding assay was performed on Synergy HT (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA) microplate reader. The ANS stock solution (2.47 mM) was prepared in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and its concentration was determined by absorbance (E 350  = 5000 M −1 cm −1 ) [ 24 ]. Human TTR (0.055 µg/µL) was incubated in the presence of 10 µM ANS and varying concentrations of BME (0.0055–0.55 µg/µL). Fluorescence intensity was measured after 10 min at excitation of 360/40 nm and emission at 460/40 nm at a temperature of 37 °C.
2.9. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the aid of Graph Pad Prism version 7 for Microsoft windows (Graph Pad Software, San Diego CA, USA). The data was statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparison analysis using Tukey’s test. Statistical significance was defined as *  p  < 0.05, **  p  < 0.01, and ***  p  < 0.001. All determinations were performed in triplicate and results represented as means ± SD.
