Here, we demonstrated for the first time the effects of PM014 against lung fibrosis with i n vivo  and  in vitro  studies. When compared with BLM-treated mice, PM014 effectively reversed the destruction of lung architecture, inhibited the influx of inflammatory cells into the lung and suppressed production of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Apparently, PM014 induced up-regulation of epithelial markers and down-regulation of mesenchymal markers  in vivo  and  in vitro , suggesting that PM014 may target EMT process in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. We also demonstrated the potential utility of PM014 as a signaling pathway inhibitor that can block TGF-β1 signaling by inactivating Smad-dependent and Smad-independent p38 MAPK signaling in alveolar epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts.
An herbal formula, PM014 is composed of 7 components of CSBHT (Chung-Sang-Bo-Ha-Tang), which has been widely used in Korea for the treatment of pulmonary diseases 10 . Our previous study showed that PM014 possessed an anti-inflammatory role in radiation-induced pulmonary inflammation, mainly due to the inhibition of inflammasome activation, with inducing a global improvement of lung function 11 . We also found that PM014 intervention effectively decreased several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which were elevated in pulmonary inflammation induced by radiation. These findings are consistent with an earlier report in which PM014 blocked the influx of inflammatory cells and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, in a murine model of COPD 12 . In the present study, lung fibrosis induced by BLM (5 mg/kg) displayed increased infiltration of inflammatory cells and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice at day 14 after bleomycin injury (Fig.  3 ). A handful of studies suggest that collagen-producing activated fibroblasts or myofibroblasts are associated with inflammatory cells including macrophages and neutrophils. Growing evidence points toward a broader connection between inflammation and lung fibrosis, despite the controversies. Indeed, lung injury is known to activate macrophages, which subsequently promote inflammation by interacting with other inflammatory cells and ultimately stimulate fibroblasts to proliferate and synthesize collagen leading to fibrosis 29 , 30 . The pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α, and TGF-β1 released from recruited inflammatory cells are capable of inducing fibrosis as pro-fibrotic factors 31 . In particular, TGF-β1 plays an important role on not only inducing EMT, but also stimulating of differentiation of IL-17 producing helper T (Th17) cells, further exacerbating inflammatory responses during lung fibrosis. In the present study, we observed enhanced expression levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, TGF-β1, and IL-17A from lungs of BLM mice on day 14 after BLM exposure, while daily administration of PM014 effectively prevented BLM-induced secretion of cytokines when it was injected on day 2 after BLM treatment (Fig.  3d–h ). However, no significant difference in the expression levels of IL-23 was observed in the lungs of BLM-treated mice compared with control mice (Fig.  3i ). IL-23 is well known to key regulator to promote the development of IL-17-procuding helper T cells 31 . Interestingly, recent studies reported that IL-17 is produced not only by Th17 cells, but also by other cells including CD8 +  T cells and neutrophils 32 , further suggesting that there are still gaps in our understanding the role of Th17 immune response in pulmonary fibrosis. Taken together, our observations have led to suggestion that PM014 may inhibit initiation and progression of the inflammatory response in lung fibrosis through antagonism of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by inflammatory cells. Future studies exploring how PM014 directly acts in an anti-inflammatory way in lung fibrosis may provide mechanistic insight into the therapeutic effects of PM014.
IPF is a complex lung disease with a poor diagnosis and few treatment options, reflecting our limited knowledge of lung fibrosis pathophysiology. Generally, three developing phases in lung fibrosis were reported on mice given by a single intratracheal injection of bleomycin 33 : during the first three days after treatment, an inflammatory phase is triggered; at around 7–14 days, inflammation has been subsided and fibrosis is detected; after 15 days, the fibrosis is developed and persists up to 4 weeks post-BLM. In the present study, we observed that enhanced inflammation in the lungs of mice treated with bleomycin at dose of 5 mg/kg at day 14 post-BLM, indicating inflammation does not completely resolve during the development of fibrotic response. Nonetheless, PM014 in dose-dependent manner suppressed these BLM-mediated inflammatory responses, including infiltration of inflammatory cells in BAL fluids (Fig.  3a–c ) and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung (Fig.  3d–i ). The anti-inflammatory effect of PM014 was confirmed by histological analysis, as evidenced by semi-quantitative quantification in H&E stained lung tissues (Fig.  1b,c ). Therefore, we speculated that the anti-inflammatory activity of PM014 in this model may be partially associated with inhibiting infiltrated inflammatory cells after lung injury. In this case, further studies about clarifying anti-inflammatory potential of PM014 during early inflammatory phase (around day 1–7 after BLM instillation) may be of great interest.
It is generally recommended to test anti-fibrotic effect of investigational products after acute inflammatory phases (at least 7–10 d after bleomycin treatment), in particular in order to confirm the therapeutic effect of drugs for treatment of lung fibrosis 17 , 18 . Recognizing the need for practical consideration, thus, we examined anti-fibrotic effect of PM014 on BLM mice with different therapeutic treatment schedules. One group received with 5 mg/kg of BLM was administered once daily with PM014 (200 mg/kg) from day 7 to day 14 after BLM exposure (Fig.  S1a–c ). The second group given with 5 mg/kg of BLM was treated once daily with PM014 (200 mg/kg) from day 10 to day 21 after BLM challenge (Fig.  S1d–f ). Unexpectedly, no significant anti-fibrotic effect was detected from PM014 + BLM mice in any therapeutic treatment group compared with BLM mice, as assessed by fibrotic Aschroft scoring (Fig.  S1b,e ) as well as weight loss associated with bleomycin (Fig.  S1c–f ). Thus, we speculated that PM014 may play preventive role in pulmonary fibrosis before fibrotic phase. Interestingly, it was recently reported that a 5-fold higher dose is required to achieve therapeutic effect than that of preventive effect 34 . Further studies are needed to test the therapeutic efficacy of PM014 with different doses in established lung fibrosis.
A growing evidence indicates that EMT is involved in the development of lung fibrosis although the details are still unclear 7 , 8 . Many histological studies showed inconsistent results in the role of EMT during lung fibrosis, mainly due to lack of available method to detect dynamic and transient state of EMT as well as marker to clearly evaluate mesenchymal phenotypes 35 , 36 . In this study, we found that PM014 significantly reversed EMT phenotypic changes from  in vivo  BLM-treated mice (Fig.  4 ) and  in vitro  TGF-β1-treated epithelial cells (Fig.  5 ) or fibroblasts (Fig.  S5 ). Surprisingly, PM014 treatment inhibited the upregulation of TGF-β1 expression in epithelial EMT-induced by TGF-β1 (Fig.  6e ). Moreover, PM014 appeared to block TGF-β1-mediated EMT via suppression of transcriptional factors including Snail and Slug which are known to key regulators of TGF-β1-induced EMT 37 , 38 . Thus, we hypothesized that PM014 exerted its anti-fibrotic effect, in particular, via inhibiting EMT or inactivating TGF-β1 signaling.
In conclusion, this study firstly demonstrates that PM014 has anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions in lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin. Additionally, mechanistic  in vitro  studies reveal that PM014 inhibits TGF-β1 signaling and ameliorates phenotypic changes of EMT and myofibroblast activation. Hence, we propose PM014 has a great potential to be alternative treatment for pulmonary fibrosis.
