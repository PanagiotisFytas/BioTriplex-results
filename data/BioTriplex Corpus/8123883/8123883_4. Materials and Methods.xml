4.1. Cell Culture
We obtained human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Catholic MASTER Cells from the Catholic Institute of Cell Therapy (CIC, Seoul, Korea). We purchased human outer root sheath cells (hORSCs) from ScienCell (San Diego, CA, USA) and cultured them, as previously described [ 49 ]. hORSCs (1 × 10 5  cells per well) were seeded into six-well culture plates in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM high glucose, Gibco BRL, Life Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Life Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, BRL) for 24 h. hORSCs at passage three to five were used for the experiments. Then, hORSCs were seeded on culture dish plates with serum-free DMEM, and the plates were co-cultured with upper chamber containing hHMSCs.
4.2. Co-Culture
The co-culture of hORSCs and hHMSCs was performed as previously described [ 50 ]. hORSCs were seeded in the lower chambers of Transwell culture plates (Cell Culture Insert Companion Plate; Corning, Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a density of 1 × 10 5  cells per well. hHMSCs were added to the upper chamber of the Transwell in separate plates at a density of 5 × 10 4  cells per well. The upper chambers were coated with polyethylene terephthalate (pore size: 0.8 mm, six-well format, Cell Culture Inserts; Corning, Falcon). After 24 h, the media was changed to serum-free DMEM and the upper chamber containing hHMSCs was transferred to the wells where the hORSCs were cultured to produce the co-culture. The IFN-γ group was treated with recombinant human IFN-gamma at 100 ng/mL, obtained from Peprotech (315-05, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). After different times (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h), the upper chamber was removed and washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, T&I, Bioprince, Chuncheon, Korea). Next, the hORSCs were harvested and used for analysis. The experiment was repeated three times.
4.3. Cell Viability Assay (MTT Assay)
Cell viability was measured via the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. After co-culturing for different times, the MTT reagent was added and reacted for 2 h. The reagent was removed, and the resulting formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) [ 51 ]. Then, the samples were assessed by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate reader.
4.4. Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the hORSCs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and cDNA was synthesized with the MG cDNA Synthesis Kit (CancerROP, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed with primers and Moloney-murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (RTase) (CancerROP, Seoul, Korea). Real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green Master mix (CancerROP, Seoul, Korea). The gene expression levels were quantified using analysis software (Quantity One 1-D analysis, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The primer sequences are listed in  Supplementary Table S1 . The primers were designed and obtained from Bioneer (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea).
4.5. Western Blot Analysis
hORSCs were harvested with RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL, USA). The amount of protein was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL, USA) and compared to bovine serum albumin (ThermoFisher) standards. Cell lysates containing the same quantity of total protein were separated by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST for an hour at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibodies against phospho-JAK1-3, total-JAK1-3, phospho-STAT1-3 total-STAT1-3, DKK1, IL-15, phospho-GSK-3β, GSK-3β, β-catenin, SOX9, CD34, CD200, and GAPDH were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Cell Signal, Beverly, MA, USA). On the following day, the membranes were washed with TBST several times and incubated in peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for 2 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (ThermoFisher) and were obtained using a chemiluminescence imaging system (ChemiDoc Imaging System; Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase.
4.6. Transwell Migration Assay
The migration of hORSCs was measured using Transwell plates that were 6.5 mm in diameter with 8 μm pore filters. The Transwell system was separated from the lower segment by a permeable membrane coated with polyethylene terephthalate. The upper chambers were loaded with 1 × 10 5  hORSCs that were already treated with IFN-γ or hHMSCs. The number of hHMSCs and density of IFN-γ were the same as those used in the co-culture procedure. DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chambers. After incubation for 15 h at room temperature, the cells in the upper chamber were carefully removed using a cotton swab and the membranes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The cells that had migrated under the filter were stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 20 min and then observed under a light microscope [ 52 ]. The cells in five randomly selected visual fields under each membrane were counted.
4.7. Hair Follicle Organ Culture Assay
Six-week-old female C57BL/6 mouse vibrissae follicles were micro-dissected under sterile conditions, as previously described [ 9 ]. Individual follicles were placed in a 24-well tissue culture plate in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM high glucose, Gibco BRL, Life Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany), which was supplemented with hydrocortisone, insulin, and glutamine in the presence of IFN-γ (100 ng/mL) or hHMSCs. hHMSCs were added to the Transwell upper chamber in separate plates at a density of 1 × 10 4  cells per well as described in the co-culture method. At least 20 HFs were cultured individually with control, IFN-γ, IFN-γ plus MSCT, or MSCT. The culture medium was changed every three days, and images of individual follicles were filmed before and after hHMSCs treatment. All procedures were carried out under the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee—approved protocols (CUMC-2019-0061-02, date of approval: 24 July 2019).
The length of vibrissae HFs from the top of hair to the bottom of the hair bulb in organ culture was measured with a microscope every third day for 10 days. Changes in hair length were calculated from the photographs and expressed as mean ± SEM of 20 vibrissae HFs.
4.8. Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. An ANOVA test and paired Student’s  t -test were used for the statistical analyses with SPSS (v.7.0) software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). All tests were one-sided, and a  p -value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
