LAIR-1 expression is significantly upregulated in circulating T cytotoxic cells in HCV G4-related HCC when compared with liver cirrhosis. LAIR-1 expression on Tc comes second to AFP sensitivity and specificity as a potential screening molecular marker for HCC related to HCV G4. However, the sensitivity of LAIR-1 expression as a noninvasive molecular marker in liquid biopsy is accepted for the detection of HCC progression from liver cirrhosis HCV G4-related infection, which opens the door for better screening of AFP-negative HCC transformation. The LAIR-1 expression on Tc is associated with insulin resistance and inflammation in the context of HCC prognosis HCV G4-related, confirming the LAIR-1 resistance component.
