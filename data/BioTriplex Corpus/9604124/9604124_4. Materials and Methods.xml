4.1. Sample Size and Power Study
Based on the previous study by Gu et al., 2021 [ 39 ], the sample size estimation was performed using the G power* sample size online calculator  https://riskcalc.org/samplesize/ # (accessed on 10 November 2021) depending on a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and power (1-beta) of 0.95. According to Gu et al., who presented their results as a graph chart, the expression mean for each group was extracted using a graph reader tool  http://www.graphreader.com/  (accessed on 10 November 2021), and standard deviations (SD) was calculated online. According to Gu et al., the gray zone group population standard deviation was (5), expected means 74, 80, and the large effect size (1.2). Therefore, calculated using the online calculator, our current study group sample size was 40 patients and 12 control participants. These sample sizes rejected the null hypothesis that the population means of the studied groups are equal with a probability (power) of 0.9.
4.2. Study Design
Case-controlled study.
4.3. Study Participants
  A random selection of apparently healthy volunteers, not suffering from any disease or taking any medication was performed. A total of 20 control participants with normal kidney and liver functions and without any clinical or laboratory evidence of steatosis or cirrhosis were included. They were recruited during routine checkup examinations for themselves or their relatives, with ages ranging from 55.5 to 60 years (16 males, 4 females).  Patients’ groups.  This study enrolled 64 HCV G4-related HCC patients recruited from the Hepatology and Gastroenterology Department, National Liver Institute, Menoufia University, with ages ranging from 57.3 to 67 years (50 males and 14 females). The HCV G4-related HCC group included 37 patients with HCV G4-related liver cirrhosis recruited from the Faculty of Medicine, Alzahraa Hospital, Al-Azhar University, with ages ranging from 54.5 to 66 years (28 males and 9 females). Full history was collected and recorded for all study participants ( n  = 101). Blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis for those who met the inclusion criteria and signed the informed consent. Blood samples were rejected for those who met the exclusion criteria.  Patients’ inclusion criteria  were adults over 18 years old with confirmed pathological examination of newly diagnosed HCC of no specific type post-HCV G4 (confirmed by serology). The  exclusion criteria  were patients with blood disorders, HBV (as determined by serology), schistosomiasis, HIV, thyroid dysfunction, inflammatory diseases, and cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, patients with HCC who were not associated with HCV were excluded. Participants receiving any chemotherapy or radiotherapy or whom had undergone a gastrointestinal surgical procedure, had any cancer other than HCC, and those with neuronal diseases, uterine diseases, kidney diseases, and prolonged use of corticosteroids or sex hormones were excluded. Finally, patients with incomplete data or incomplete histopathology diagnosis report were excluded.  Patients’ clinical and pathological features.  Patients’ tumor clinical assessment was performed at the Pathology Unit, Faculty of Medicine. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed by an expert who was blinded to the study. CT data were CT scan liver size and mass number from 1 to 4, incidence of cirrhosis with heterogeneous mass, or focal or multiple lesions and the portal vein, whether occluded or thrombosed [ 40 ]. The International Ascites Club [ 41 ] classifies the severity classification of ascites as mild ascites (grade 1), ascites only detectable by ultrasound; moderate ascites (grade 2), moderate abdominal distention; and massive ascites (grade 3), marked large abdominal distention. Regarding the severity of liver disease, the Child-Pugh-Turcotte scoring was attempted; A least severe, B moderately severe, C most severe. BCLC staging for HCC were 0 very early stage, A early, B intermediate, C advanced, and D terminal stage.
LN involvement with enlargement incidence either as no (N0) or present (N1) was recorded from patients’ data. HCV was the G4 endemic in Egypt, confirmed by serology. HCV G4 was confirmed in patients with liver cirrhosis more than 6 months ago. According to recent standards, HCC diagnosis was histologically verified or based on specified imaging criteria [ 42 ], and only early diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients with HCC were included.
4.4. Blood Samples
Six milliliters of peripheral venous blood were withdrawn from each participant under strict sterile conditions following standard biosecurity and international safety procedures and divided into two aliquots. Blood was withdrawn at the time patients were first diagnosed clinically with HCC and before any medical therapy or surgical intervention. The first 3 mL of blood was placed into EDTA anticoagulant vacutainers for complete blood count using Sysmex KX-21 (the automated haematology analyser KX-21 manufactured by Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) and FC assay. The rest of the blood was transferred into a polymer serum gel separator tube with a clot activator (Kremsmünster, Upper Austria, Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Australia) left for 15 min at room temperature (24 °C) to clot, followed by 10-min centrifugation at 10,000×  g  at 4 °C. Sera obtained were aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes and stored at −80 °C until biochemical assessment.

           4.5.1. Biochemical Testing 
           Routine biochemical testing. Liver function tests : alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total and direct bilirubin, and serum albumin.  Lipid profile measurements : triacylglycerol (TAG), total cholesterol (TC), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Finally, serum creatinine as a  kidney function indicator . Serum glucose determination. All were performed using Cobas Integra 400 Plus, Roche Diagnostics, Germany.  Serum alpha-fetoprotein  (AFP) determination was performed using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) using Cobas 6000 (e601 module), Roche Diagnostics, Germany.  INR  coagulation assay using an automated coagulation analyzer (STA Compact Max, Asnières sur Seine Cedex, Stago, France). 
           43 ]. Based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent test (ELISA) in solid phase, using a HyPrep automated ELISA system (Hyperion Inc., Miami, FL, USA). The test sample’s color intensity is directly inversely related to its insulin concentration. The normal insulin adult range level is 0–25 mU/L. Serum insulin assay was performed using enzyme immunoassay for the quantitative determination of human serum insulin concentrations [

           Insulin Resistance  is considered positive in obese, diabetic, and dyslipidemic patients, and those with insulin levels of 18 mU/mL or more after glucose/meal, with disturbed PLR [ 47 , 48 ]. 
        

           4.5.3. FC Assay 
           6 ) in each sample. Blood was incubated with 5 µg of each fluorochrome-conjugated antibody anti-human IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated anti-human CD3 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California, CA, USA. Cat. No. 555332), phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human CD LAIR-1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California, CA, USA. cat. no. 550811, lot no. 5329747), and peridinin–chlorophyll–protein complex (PerCP)-conjugated anti-human CD8 (Analysis, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA, cat. no. MA1-19793) for identification of Tc cells expressing LAIR-1. The compensation setting was established before acquiring samples using color-calibrated beads (BD, Biosciences, San Jose, California, CA, USA, lot no. 5093879). FC was performed for Tc and lymphocyte % quantification and LAIR-1 expression determination. FC was conducted using the four-color FACSCalibur (Biosciences Becton, Dickinson and Company, San Jose, California, CA, USA). One tube was prepared for each patient, using 50 µg of fresh peripheral venous blood sample after adjustment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells cell count (1 × 10 
           Gating strategy (antibody testing strategy):  Initial gating by typical forward and sideway scatter on mature lymphocytes expected area was performed, and Tc cells were then evaluated as the percentage of total lymphocytes, according to the surface marker expression as CD3 + CD8 + . Subsequently, the percentage of Tc expressing LAIR-1 and LAIR-1 MFI were detected on single histogram from CD3 + CD8 +  co-expressing population. The MFI of positive population was detected in the area under the M1 marker ( Figure 1 ). 
        
4.6. Statistical Analysis
Data collected were coded and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science software (SPSS, Version 17, Chicago, IL, USA). Qualitative data were presented as frequencies ( n ) and percentages (%). Test for data normality was performed using the Shapiro–Wilk calculator, wherein normally distributed variables were expressed as means  +  SDs and analyzed using two samples independent Students’  t -test or ANOVA for comparison of two or more groups, respectively. Data were presented as medians (interquartile ranges as first to third quartiles or 25th–75th quartiles) if not normally distributed; subsequently, the Mann–Whitney (U) or Kruskal–Wallis (H) test was performed to compare any two or more independent groups, respectively. Kruskal–Wallis post hoc was conducted to determine which pairs of groups significantly differed. Student’s  t -test and Chi-square χ2 test were used to compare quantitative and qualitative, normally distributed variables between the patients and control groups, respectively. Spearman’s  rho  correlation test was used to assess the association between quantitative nonparametric variables. Point-biserial correlations were used to determine the correlation between parameters when one of them was a dichotomous variable. ROC curve was performed to detect the best cutoff, sensitivities (SNs), and specificities (SPs), with an area under the curve (AUC) calculated range from 0 to 1. The higher the AUC, the better the parameter in classifying the outcomes correctly. ROC curve calculated values would provide an idea of how well the discriminating ability of LAIR-1+Tc% and/or LAIR-1 MFI on Tc to differentiate post-treated HCV G4 HCC cases from liver cirrhosis cases. The level of significance was set at  p -value < 0.05 and confidence level or interval at 95% and 5%, respectively.
