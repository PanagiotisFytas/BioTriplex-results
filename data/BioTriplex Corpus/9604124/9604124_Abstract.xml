Title: Cytotoxic T Cell Expression of Leukocyte-Associated Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor-1 (LAIR-1) in Viral Hepatitis C-Mediated Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
Abstract: Virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis involves liver inflammation, therefore, despite successful treatment, hepatitis C virus (HCV) may progress to HCC from initiated liver cirrhosis. Cytotoxic T cells (Tcs) are known to be involved in HCV-related cirrhotic complications and HCC pathogenesis. The inhibitory checkpoint leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1) is expressed on Tcs. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether the Tc expression level of LAIR-1 is associated with HCC progression and to evaluate LAIR-1 expression as a noninvasive biomarker for HCC progression in the context of liver cirrhosis related to HCV genotype 4 (G4) in Egyptian patients’ peripheral venous blood liquid biopsy. A total of 64 patients with HCC and 37 patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled in this case-controlled study, and their LAIR-1 expression on Tc related to the progression of liver cirrhosis was examined and compared to that of the apparently healthy control group ( n  = 20). LAIR-1 expression was analyzed using flow cytometry. Results: The HCC group had significantly higher LAIR-1 expression on Tc and percentage of Tc positive for LAIR-1 (LAIR-1+Tc%) than the HCV G4-related liver cirrhosis group. LAIR-1+Tc% was correlated with the HCC surrogate tumor marker AFP ( r  = 0.367,  p  = 0.001) and insulin resistance and inflammation prognostic ratios/indices. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that adding LAIR-1+Tc% to AFP can distinguish HCC transformation in the Egyptian patients’ cohort. Upregulated LAIR-1 expression on Tc could be a potential screening noninvasive molecular marker for chronic inflammatory HCV G4 related liver cirrhosis. Moreover, LAIR-1 expression on Tc may be one of the players involved in the progression of liver cirrhosis to HCC.
