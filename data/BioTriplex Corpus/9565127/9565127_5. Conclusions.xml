During the pandemic’s first year, the age-standardized mortality rates related to COPD increased by 16%, reverting the downward trend observed during 2008–2019. In contrast, the number of deaths from COPD as the underlying cause declined in 2020 due to COVID-19 acting as a competing cause. Only multiple causes of death data allowed us to measure to which extent the pandemic waves in 2020, in the absence of vaccination, affected COPD-related mortality. The results of the present study represent a necessary step for a more accurate estimate of the subsequent positive impact of COVID-19 vaccination on COPD patients. To this purpose, future analyses extended to 2021–2022 data are warranted.
