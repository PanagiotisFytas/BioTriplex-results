This is a population-based study on mortality records examined by means of time series analyses. The mortality register of the Veneto region includes all diseases mentioned in death certificates coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The UCOD is selected from all conditions reported on certificates according to rules set by the World Health Organization. To standardize the UCOD assignment, the Automated Classification of Medical Entities (ACME) software was applied to regional records until 2017 [ 24 ]. From 2018, the IRIS software was adopted, as in most European countries. The change in software corresponded to the adoption of slightly different rules for UCOD selection based on the 2016 version of ICD-10 [ 25 ].
All the death certificates of residents in Veneto aged ≥ 40 years with any mention of COPD (ICD-10 codes J40–J44, J47) were analyzed from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2020. ICD-10 codes selection was the same adopted in mortality data reported from the European Union [ 1 ] and in a previous study carried out in Veneto in 2008–2012 [ 7 ]. The age-standardized mortality rates (direct standardization, 2013 European reference population) and proportional mortality (share out of all deaths) were computed for COPD selected as the UCOD, and for any mention in death certificates (MCOD). Changes in trends over pre-pandemic years were assessed using the Joinpoint software (US National Cancer Institute Surveillance Research Program, version 4.8); the average annual percent change in age-standardized rates (APC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was estimated for the period 2008–2019 from linear regression models applied to the logarithm of the age-standardized rates.
Trends in the proportion of common comorbidities and complications among death certificates that mentioned COPD were examined as MCOD and UCOD in four separate study periods: 2008–2012, 2013–2017, and 2018–2019 (period when new rules to determine the UCOD started to be applied), and 2020 (first year of the pandemic). The comorbidities and complications investigated were: hypertensive diseases (ICD-10 codes I10–I13), ischemic heart diseases (I20–I25), cerebrovascular diseases (I60–I69), neoplasms (C00–D48), diabetes (E10–E14), dementia/Alzheimer’s disease (F01–F03, G30), COVID-19 (U07.1, U07.2), and common infectious diseases (A00–B99, J00–J22, J69, J85–J86, N10–N12, N13.6, N15.1, N39.0, N70–N76).
The impact of the pandemic on COPD-related mortality was assessed using two approaches. First, the monthly number of COPD-related deaths (based on UCOD and MCOD) observed in 2020 was compared with the corresponding monthly average of the previous two years, when the IRIS software was already adopted for UCOD selection. The ratio of observed to expected deaths (2018–2019 average) was computed with 95% CI based on the Poisson distribution for the entire year and separately for the first (March–May) and second (October–December) epidemic waves experienced in the region by 2020. 
Thereafter, the COPD-related mortality observed in 2020 (MCOD approach) was compared to expected values obtained from the 2008–2019 data. For this purpose, a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (SARIMA) was applied to monthly age-standardized mortality rates from 2008 to 2019 and adopted to the forecast figures for the year 2020 by sex and overall. These models accounted for both time trends and the strong seasonality of COPD mortality, which were previously reported [ 7 ]. The best fitting SARIMA models were selected on the basis of the lowest corrected Akaike Information Criterion values. The ratio between the observed rates and those predicted by the model was used to estimate excess mortality [ 26 ]. The data were analyzed using STATA software (Release 16) (StataCorp, College Station, TX, US).
