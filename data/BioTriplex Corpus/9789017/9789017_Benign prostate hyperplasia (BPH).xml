Androgens in BPH development
Androgens and androgen receptor (AR) signaling are necessary for normal prostate growth and homeostasis and have been linked to the development and maintenance of BPH. During puberty, testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5α reductase (5AR) within the prostate and that stimulates the prostate to grow to its adult size. In the normal prostate gland, this conversion of testosterone to DHT is of utmost importance for promoting the AR signaling which influences cell proliferation, differentiation, morphogenesis, and functional maintenance [ 13 ]. Support of a similar setting in BPH can be derived from the clinical experience that 5α reductase inhibitors (5ARI) are used to reduce DHT and thereby slow progression of clinical BPH [ 14 ]. In several observational studies, no associations with BPH and higher serum testosterone have been reported [ 15 – 17 ], suggesting that higher serum testosterone concentrations do not promote BPH. In one of these studies [ 15 ], high testosterone was associated with a decreased risk for BPH while low testosterone increased the risk. Also, estrogens have been suggested to play a role in regulating stromal-epithelial interactions involved in prostatic cellular growth [ 18 ], although the exact role remains unclear.
Aging as a risk factor for BPH
Recently it has been suggested that several metabolic disorders more common in older ages, including hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and obesity might be important in the development of BPH [ 19 – 21 ]. Another key aspect on BPH development is inflammation [ 22 ], which is an important aspect of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and associated with low testosterone and hyperestrogenism [ 23 ].
The metabolic syndrome in BPH
MetS has been recognized as a cluster of some common medical disorders such as visceral obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia which increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) [ 24 ]. Previous studies suggest an association of MetS with BPH [ 25 ]. In an investigation in 158 men, individual MetS components such as T2DM, hypertension, obesity, high insulin, and low high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels were all found to be risk factors for the development of BPH [ 26 ]. In a more recent large cross sectional epidemiological study, it was shown that the risk of having MetS in men with clinical BPH was increased by 37% [ 27 ]. The mechanistic link between MetS and BPH is basically unknown. MetS is associated with low grade chronic inflammation with increased serum markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and proinflammatory cytokines [ 28 ,  29 ]. Inflammation in prostate biopsies has been associated with BPH progression [ 30 ] and increased CRP is associated with increased risk for BPH and LUTS [ 31 ]. The role of androgens in this context is unclear since MetS also is associated with low testosterone levels [ 32 ,  33 ].
Senescence in the etiology of BPH
Aging tissue is associated with an increased number of senescent cells [ 34 ]. Senescence is a non-replicative state in which cells end up after irreparable DNA damage [ 35 ], and can be seen as a tumor suppressive mechanism. In a mouse model, reduced testosterone levels were associated with increased cell senescence and vascular remodeling, indicating that the low testosterone levels may indirectly influence the development of aging-related diseases [ 36 ]. Although senescent cells do not proliferate, they remain metabolically active and secrete inflammatory mediators [ 37 ], which contribute to the state of low-grade inflammation associated with age in both animals and humans [ 38 ]. Several studies have reported senescent prostate epithelial cells in almost all BPH samples investigated [ 39 ,  40 ], and the overlapping between the senescent secretome and mediators identified as promoting BPH suggests that this age-related feature may be an important factor in BPH pathology (as reviewed in [ 41 ]).
BPH is one of the most common diseases in the aging male. Its prevalence increases from 30 to 40% in the 4th decade of life to 70–80% in those older than 80 years [ 6 – 8 ]. BPH is a histological diagnosis caused by hyperproliferation of epithelial and stromal cells in the transition zone of the prostate [ 9 ]. The consequences of BPH are in most cases benign prostatic enlargement and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Observational studies from various parts of the world clearly demonstrate that older age is an important risk factor for development of BPH [ 7 ,  10 ]. The BPH initiating mechanisms are largely unknown. BPH is also considered as partly a hereditary disease. Male relatives and brothers to men below 64 years and undergoing surgery for BPH had a 4-6-fold increased age-specific risk for BPH surgery [ 11 ]. The hereditary form of BPH is associated with larger prostate volume and younger age of onset when compared with sporadic BPH [ 12 ].
