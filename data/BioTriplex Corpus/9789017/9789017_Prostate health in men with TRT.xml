TRT and risk of developing BPH
As described above, it appears that androgens in some ways are involved in the development of BPH. It is also known that BPH is strongly related to age, and during aging, serum androgens are decreasing indicating that also other factors are involved in BPH development [ 136 ]. Furthermore, in a study of more than 4000 men with BPH, no association between PSA, prostate size and testosterone levels were found [ 137 ]. In a systematic review of the literature, it was clearly demonstrated that in men with LOH, TRT did not have any influence on prostate size [ 138 ]. In a randomized trial, TRT was also associated with improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms, which are complaints strongly associated with BPH in aging males [ 139 ]. Although patients with severe LUTS were excluded from most studies, there appears not to be any increased risk for BPH/LUTS in patients on TRT.
TRT and risk of developing prostate cancer
Restoring testosterone levels in med with LOH has long been associated with a fear of inducing PC. However, it has been demonstrated that the incidence of PC among men on TRT was not higher than that in the general population [ 134 ]. Although there is no level one evidence, there are several large observational studies supporting that hypogonadal men on TRT do not have an increased risk for PC diagnosis. A study including 750 men on TRT found no increased risk of PC [ 140 ], which was supported by a larger study including almost 13,000 men also demonstrating no association between TRT [ 141 ]. In addition, a lower proportion of aggressive PC cases in the TRT group has been shown [ 142 ]. Taken together, all these studies point to, in line with the saturation model, that restoring testosterone levels by TRT in hypogonadal men does not increase the risk of PC. However, while waiting for more conclusive evidence, it is reasonable to offer PSA monitoring on a regular basis during TRT, as well as to check PSA before initiating TRT.
TRT in men diagnosed with PC
There is growing evidence of health benefits of TRT for men with LOH. However, concurrent or historical, PC has conventionally been considered as an absolute contraindication for TRT for these men. In clinical practice, this standpoint is gradually starting to change since normalization of serum testosterone levels does not appear to drive PC progression in men with LOH treated with testosterone.

           TRT in men with low-risk PC 
           143 ]. To date, there are no randomized controlled trials that investigated the risk of TRT in men on AS. In a retrospective cohort study of 82 hypogonadal men with PC on AS and on TRT followed for up to 41 months, despite a small increase in PSA, no patients progressed to a higher Gleason grade on subsequent biopsies [ 144 ]. A retrospective observational study including 13 hypogonadal men with low-risk PC on AS and TRT for a 2.5-year median treatment duration, showed neither PSA nor prostate volume changes, and no PC progression was observed [ 145 ]. In another study, it was shown that the biopsy progression rates in testosterone-deficient men on AS was similar in 28 men on TRT compared to 96 untreated men [ 146 ]. Active surveillance (AS) is the choice of treatment strategy for patients with low-risk prostate cancer [ 
           147 ]. Prospective randomized clinical trials in this field are needed. To summarize, in hypogonadal men on AS for low stage/grade PC, the current body of evidence supporting TRT is restricted to a few small, retrospective observational studies. Taken together, these studies are not conclusive regarding the safe use of TRT in hypogonadal men on AS, as some studies reported high progression rates for patients on TRT during AS [ 
        

           TRT in men treated for PC 
           143 ]. The question is whether TRT is safe for men with LOH previously treated for localized PC. RP and radiotherapy are effective and common approaches for treatment of localized PC [ 
           148 ], it was reported that after TRT, the PSA remained undetectable. In another retrospective study of men treated for LOH after RP, no biochemical recurrences were noted during the follow up of 7–18 months [ 149 ]. In a mixed cohort of patients with both high and low risk PC treated with RP, including patients on TRT because of testosterone deficiency followed for 36 months, a PSA increase was observed in the TRT group, but with more biopsy verified PC-recurrences in the group without TRT [ 150 ]. Although the lack of sufficiently large and lengthy prospective trials is obvious, these two observational studies suggest that there is no apparent increase in PC recurrence in men treated with TRT after RP. In a small case series on a group of men treated with RP and without biochemical recurrence [ 
           151 ]. In a larger retrospective study, 98 men with PC and treated with radiotherapy and subsequently given testosterone for LOH, a clinically insignificant increase in mean PSA was observed [ 152 ]. Also, for radiotherapy, the sparse data available does not show that the use of TRT increase the risk of worsen PC severity. In a recent systematic review of available literature [ 147 ], eight out of nine included studies showed that TRT-treated patients with PC treated by radiation therapy did not have an increased risk for disease progression. However, the overall quality of available evidence is poor and prospective controlled studies are lacking. For radiotherapy, such as external beam radiation or brachytherapy, data regarding TRT is sparse. In an early study from 2007, it was concluded that no biochemical recurrence occurred in patients treated with brachytherapy and subsequently with testosterone due to LOH [ 
           147 ]. Thus, despite the non-conclusive nature of the evidence, TRT should not be recommended for this patient group. In the same systematic review, seven out of nine included studies indicated that TRT appears to be harmful for patients with advanced PC, although the quality of the included studies was poor [ 
           1 ). Table 1 Overview of TRT in relation to prostate health issues Prostate health situation Interpretation of current data Comments General PSA screening programs Patients on TRT can be included Lower PSA cut-off may be considered BPH and TRT No concerns Could even be beneficial PC development and TRT Data indicate no increased risk Randomized controlled trials are lacking Low-risk PC and TRT No observed risk for progression Evidence is sparse Localized PC and TRT   after radical prostatectomy No observed increased risk for relapse Observational studies only    after radiotherapy No observed increased risk for relapse Evidence is sparse Advanced PC and TRT TRT potentially harmful Not recommended TRT  testosterone replacement therapy,  PSA  prostate specific antigen,  BPH  benign prostate hyperplasia,  PC  prostate cancer In summary, despite the potentially harmful role of TRT in advanced PC, the risks with TRT for patients with low-risk and treated localized PC appear to be small. However, since this cannot be concluded based on current evidence, whether TRT should be initiated in individual PC patients needs to be carefully considered, while careful monitoring of PC patients on TRT is strongly recommended for safety reasons (Table
