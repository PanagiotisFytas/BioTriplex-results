Androgens in prostate cancer development
Ever since the efficacy of castration, or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), was proven 80 years ago, it has been the mainstay for the management of metastatic PC [ 49 ], indicating that testosterone is a driving factor for PC. It is known that both normal prostate epithelial cells and PC cells are dependent on androgens for their proliferation and survival [ 50 ,  51 ], even if androgen regulated epithelial proliferation in the normal prostate largely is mediated by stromal cells [ 52 ,  53 ]. However, despite comprehensive investigations, there are today no conclusive support for an increased risk of PC associated with higher testosterone in the physiological range. In 2016, a meta-analysis combining data from 20 separate studies, comprising samples from almost 20,000 men with a mean follow-up of 10 years, concluded that the levels of endogenous steroids were not associated with PC risk [ 54 ]. Contradicting this epidemiologic evidence, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) randomizing healthy men to a 5ARI (finasteride), blocking conversion of testosterone into DHT, reported that finasteride was associated with a reduction in diagnosed PC cases [ 55 ]. However, after 18-yr follow-up, no differences were observed between the two groups in overall and cancer specific mortality rates [ 56 ]. In principle, comparable results were obtained in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) phase III trial using another 5ARI, dutasteride, where men with a negative prostate biopsy were randomized to dutasteride or placebo. A 23% reduction in the rate of PC diagnosis was observed in the dutasteride arm after 4 years [ 57 ]. However, up to now neither finasteride nor dutasteride have been approved for chemoprevention for PC due to the lack of survival advantages. It has been suggested that 5ARI results in a higher proportion of tumors with higher Gleason grading [ 55 ]. However, no difference in mortality was shown between 5ARI users and nonusers within the same Gleason group in a large registry-based study [ 58 ]. This may be explained by a biopsy bias due to the shrinking prostates in treated men, or that 5ARI inhibits tumors with lower Gleason scores that would not have caused the death of the patients.

           Higher levels of endogenous testosterone do not drive PC 
           59 – 62 ]. The same appears to be valid for baseline levels of androgens before ADT, where also no associations or association with higher testosterone levels and poor prognosis have been reported [ 63 ,  64 ]. Even if physiological levels of testosterone do not seem to be a risk factor for development of PC, another important question is whether it impacts the progression of a pre-existing PC, localized or metastasized. Several studies have addressed the risk of PC progression after radical prostatectomy (RP) in relation to baseline levels of testosterone. Almost unanimously, they suggest that higher levels of testosterone do not confer an increased risk of progression of localized PC [ 
        

           Saturation of the AR limits effect of testosterone 
           65 ], using extracted data from numerous studies as support. They relate to binding assays that show that prostate cells have a maximum of AR stimulation at 2–4 nM when all ARs are supposed to be bound by ligand, above which increase in testosterone results in negligible stimulation [ 66 ]. Supporting this,  in vitro  studies using PC cells also show a maximum stimulation of proliferation by testosterone approximately at 1 nM [ 67 ,  68 ]. The limited effect of concentrations of testosterone above this threshold was in line with studies in castrated rats supplemented with increasing doses of androgens, that showed rapid prostate regrowth in the lowest concentrations, above which a plateau was reached [ 69 – 71 ]. In eugonadal men, serum testosterone is 10-35nM, which is substantially higher than the saturation point for AR. In addition, the conversion of testosterone into DHT by 5AR in prostate cells may contribute to the rapid saturation of AR, since DHT has a higher affinity to AR compared to testosterone (Fig.  1 ). In line with this, several human studies show that increasing serum testosterone levels within the physiological range does not correlate with PSA secretion and prostate volume [ 72 – 76 ]. It has also been indicated that the intra-prostatic levels of androgens do not necessarily reflect changes in testosterone concentrations in the circulation [ 77 ,  78 ]. Rather constant testosterone and DHT concentrations in the prostate, despite increasing circulating levels in the physiological range, could also explain the lack of response to androgen modulations in the studies mentioned above. Together, this buffered prostatic environment and the saturation model for the AR provide robust evidence that modulating physiological testosterone levels does not significantly influence the androgenic stimulation of prostatic tissue. All these data collectively do not support a promoting role of testosterone on PC. One explanation for the apparent contradiction with the therapeutic effects of castration on PC, is the saturation model put forward by Morgentaler and Traish in 2009 [ 
           Fig. 1 Simplified illustration of AR saturation in prostate cells. Translation of a certain testosterone (T) concentration in the circulation into saturated androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cells due to conversion into the more potent AR activator dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5-alpha reductase (5AR), compared to a relatively inefficient binding of testosterone to AR in non-prostate cells with lower 5AR activity. In the saturated prostate cell, all ARs are bound by ligand, while, at the same serum concentration of testosterone, a proportion of ARs in other organs is still free for activation 
 
        

           Lower levels of endogenous testosterone as a risk factor for aggressive disease 
           59 ,  79 ], and predicted poorer survival on ADT [ 63 ]. These associations do not fully fit into the saturation model, since even at these somewhat lower testosterone levels, the AR should be fully saturated and activated. Nevertheless, this connection was supported by the two studies mentioned above, where treatment with 5ARI was associated with fewer PC cases in total, but an increased proportion of high-risk tumors was seen [ 55 ,  57 ]. There are no experimental proofs for a dedifferentiation process of prostate cells initiated by these modest decreases in testosterone levels, but several studies have shown that castrate levels of testosterone (< 0.7 nM [ 80 ], below the saturation point) induce altered differentiation and increased metastatic potential of PC cells [ 81 – 83 ]. Intriguingly, in some of the above-mentioned studies, lower testosterone was associated with more frequent aggressive high-risk disease [ 
        
Aging as a risk factor for prostate cancer
As mentioned above, age is the main risk factor for PC. Numerous studies have shown that the concentration of testosterone in men decreases with age, although the rate of decline differs somewhat between studies [ 84 – 86 ]. However, since the association with neither high nor low testosterone levels display a verified association with PC, there may be other factors than the age-related decrease in testosterone levels that affect the incidence of PC. Aging is associated with an increased risk for development of most cancer forms, since the total amount of mutations accumulate over the years [ 87 ], which has been demonstrated to be true also for prostate cancer cells [ 88 ]. The prostate is the only organ that continues to grow throughout the male life span. In line with this, in contrast to many organs [ 89 ,  90 ], old prostates maintain their progenitor capacity [ 91 ]. Actually, it has recently been demonstrated that the frequency of luminal cells with high progenitor activity are more frequent in prostates from older men [ 91 ,  92 ].

           Age-related inflammation in PC development 
           93 ]. In addition, old prostate cells of both epithelial and stromal origin display an inflammatory expression profile [ 94 ]. The association between PC and inflammation has been shown in numerous studies [ 95 ,  96 ]. Most convincing of a temporal association between chronic inflammation and the development of PC is a study conducted on the population included in the PCPT and SELECT studies [ 55 ,  97 ], where men in the untreated control arm who later developed PC (in the SELECT trial) displayed a higher degree of inflammation at baseline (i.e. at the end of PCPT trial) [ 98 ]. Interestingly, testosterone is believed to have an overall immunosuppressive role [ 99 ,  100 ], and despite the limited epidemiological evidence for its active role in PC development, testosterone may still influence immune cells and the inflammatory status of the prostate, irrespective of the saturation model working in prostate cells. This is supported by the observation that inflammation was more prominent among men treated with finasteride in the PCPT trial [ 98 ]. Besides the increased mutational load, other age-related changes may be involved in the increased incidence of PC in elderly men. In animal studies, it has been shown that the numbers of T- and B-cells, as well as macrophages are increased in prostates from older mice compared to young mice, corresponding to a gene expression pattern indicative of a pro-inflammatory micro-environment [ 
        

           Aging of prostate microenvironment 
           36 ,  93 ], features that might not be directly associated with PC initiation, but could affect both PC growth and differentiation [ 101 ,  102 ]. The prostate microenvironment can also work as a controlling and suppressing force, in the sense of maintaining normal organ function and thereby inhibiting excessive cancerous growth [ 103 ,  104 ]. In relation to aging, it has been shown that conditioned media from prostate stromal cells isolated from elderly men do not suppress the growth of prostate epithelial cells as efficiently, when compared to cells isolated from younger men [ 105 ]. The microenvironment is a crucial part of cancer biology. It constitutes the ecosystem in which the cancer cells develop and grow, and which some of them eventually leave to form metastases. In addition to the increased inflammation, structural changes appear in the prostatic microenvironment with age. These aging effects include changes in the collagen network as well as vascular remodeling [ 
        

           The metabolic syndrome as risk factor for PC 
           106 ]. MetS and its different aspects have been shown to be predictive for and play a role in the etiology of PC [ 107 ]. It is well known that T2DM, linked to both obesity and LOH [ 108 ], is associated with a lower number of incident PC [ 109 ,  110 ]. However, this may be a detection bias since diabetes is often associated with low PSA, in turn related to hypogonadism [ 111 ]. Nevertheless, an inverse relationship between T2DM and PC of different stage or grade has been demonstrated [ 112 ]. Besides T2DM, also obesity, especially visceral obesity, is an established aspect of MetS [ 24 ], and has been clearly linked to PC risk [ 113 ,  114 ]. In three large cohort studies a positive association between general adiposity and advanced PC was shown [ 115 – 117 ]. There are biological mechanisms that can explain the links between obesity and PC. Obesity is associated with increased levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, which promote PC and has been demonstrated to increased PC risk [ 118 ,  119 ]. On the cellular level, it was demonstrated that peritumoral adipocytes that secrete the chemokine CCL7 could facilitate migration and invasion of PC cells expressing CCR3, a receptor often upregulated in PC compared to normal prostate [ 120 ]. This can influence the spreading of PC cells outside the prostate and the establishment in the adipocyte rich bone marrow [ 121 ]. As in the case with BPH, MetS is also associated with PC, as both are more frequent in older age, although the relation is more inexplicit [ 
        
Worldwide, PC is the second most common malignancy in men and the fifth commonest cause of cancer mortality [ 42 ]. There are large variations in incidence and mortality rates according to geographical location with Sweden among the top rated regarding both incidence and mortality [ 43 ]. Based on the geographical variations of incidence and mortality, dietary factors have been thoroughly investigated, but the evidence so far remains inconclusive. The widespread usage of early detection strategies based on prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements have resulted in increased incidence of PC in US and Europe with increase of indolent disease and a decrease of metastatic disease [ 44 ].
PC shows increased incidence with increasing age, and up to 80% of men over the age of 80 years harbor PC cells [ 45 ]. Besides age, well established risk factors for PC development are genetic predisposition, family history, and ethnicity [ 43 ]. An increased risk for high grade PC was observed in patients with the metabolic syndrome [ 46 ]. Obesity is associated with metabolic disturbances and is also associated with PC aggressiveness [ 47 ]. Chronic inflammation has been suggested as a potential link between metabolic disorders and PC risk [ 48 ].
