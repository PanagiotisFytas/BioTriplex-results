Information of the cohort
A total of 32 centenarians (G1), 30 elderly people (G2) and 11 young people (G3) were recruited. Characteristics of study participants for 16S rRNA analysis were shown in Table S1A. Statistically significant differences in age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status were found among three groups (Table S1A). No significant differences for food preference and diseases among three groups were observed in 16S rRNA sequencing (Table S1A). Characteristics of study participants for metagenomics sequencing were listed in table S1B. No significant differences for food Preference, BMI, smoking, and disease status among three groups were observed in metagenomics samples (Table S1B). Elderly group in both 16S rRNA and metagenomics analysis showed significantly increased alcohol consumption in comparison to young and centenarian groups (Table S1A and Table S1B). The detailed characteristics, including the diseases, food preference, smoking status, taking probiotics or not and alcohol consumption for all samples are shown in Table S2.
Centenarians (G1) displayed alterations in gut microbiota compared with elderly people (G2) and young people (G3) based on 16S rRNA data
After selecting the effective reads, each fecal sample produced 80,268 to 99,917 effective reads. Rarefaction curve analysis reached a stable level, indicating that the sequencing depth had covered new rare phylotypes and most of the diversity (Figure S1A). As shown in  Figure 1a , the Venn diagram displayed 380 unique amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in the G1 group, 216 unique ASVs in the G2 group, and 46 unique ASVs in the G3 group; furthermore, 684 ASVs were shared by the three groups. Estimates of richness and Shannon index were calculated to quantify bacterial alpha diversity. No statistical difference between G1 and G2 was found, but the G3 group showed significantly lower estimate of richness than the G1 group ( Figure 1b, c ). A principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) analysis showed three groups displaying similar microbiota composition ( Figure 1d  and Figure. S1B). The top 10 phyla in the relative abundance of gut microbiota were shown as histograms ( Figure 1e ). At the phylum level, we observed a moderate significant enrichment of  Verrucomicrobia  in G1 compared with G3 ( Figure 1e  and Table S3). As the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio is often used as an index for the structure of gut microbiota, we compared the ratio in three groups. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was higher in subjects of elderly than in the young and centenarian group, whereas the proportion of Bacteroidetes was lower in elderly group, accordingly, we found a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the elderly than in the young and centenarians ( Figure 1f ).

Bar plots showing the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in three groups. (g). Heat map showing the relative abundance of three groups of individuals at genus level. Only the significantly different genera between any two groups were displayed. Based on the different genera obtained by Wilcoxon rank sum test (Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected P value < .05), 10 samples were randomly returned from each group to form self-help samples. The average difference statistics of relative genus abundance were calculated and repeated 1000 times to determine whether the difference was significant according to 90% confidence interval. (h). Changes in the relative abundance of genera between G3, G2, and G1 subjects grouped according to the rejuvenation signature.
To reconstruct the microbiota changed trajectory along aging, the relative abundances of the genera with significant differences between any two groups were displayed in  Figure 1g  (Table S4). The commensal genera  Odoribacter, Ruminococcaceae UCG−003, and Desulfovibrio  enriched with aging ( Figure 1g ). Some opportunistic bacteria, e.g.,  Parabacteroides, Butyricimonas , and  Alistipes  only enriched in centenarian group. According to the previous report, rejuvenation signature included genera whose abundance was similar in younger and centenarian, but distinct from the elderly group. 15 
 Howardella  and  Rikenellaceae RC9  genera were included in rejuvenation signature and specifically enriched in G1 group ( Figure 1h ), and the absolute abundance of these two genera was also found to be increased in G1 group (Figure S1C), indicating these genera may have potential role in preservation of youth or reversing aging. Centenarian signature included centenarian-specific genera whose abundance was similar in G3 and G2 groups but distinct from the G1 group per previous definition. 15  We found the absolute abundance of  Desulfovibrio  and  Pseudomonas  genera were included in the centenarian signature and specifically enriched in G1 group (Figure. S1D). Notably,  Parabacteroides  and  Odoribacter , which were enriched in the G1 group, are known to resist inflammation and contribute to gut health. 16 , 17  Functional analysis showed that the activities of vitamin B6 metabolism and thiamine metabolism were lower in G1, whereas retinol metabolism and tryptophan metabolism were higher in G1 group (Figure. S1E, F).
Given that bacteria act as interdependent functional groups (guilds) in the gut ecosystem, 18 , 19  synergistic changes of bacteria in guilds may help identify bacteria that play an important role in long-lived families. Hence, we further constructed a co-abundance network at the ASV level. A total of 462 ASVs were shared by at least 20% of the samples and clustered into 46 guilds based on SparCC correlation coefficients (Table S5). Only 21 guilds with ASVs whose absolute value of correlation coefficient was greater than 0.70 were shown in  Figure 2a  and Table S6. According to the Kruskal–Wallis test, group level abundance analysis showed that six guilds showed significant differences among the three groups. Notably, guild2 showed decreased abundance in G1 compared with G3, and the guild contained the genera,  Dialister, Parasutterella , and  Acidaminococcus  which showed decreased abundance in G1 group. In addition, guild34 and guild46 were enriched in G1 relative to G3, and the two guilds contained the genera,  Alistipes, Ruminococcaceae UCG-005 , and  Faecalitalea  which showed elevated abundance in G1 group ( Figure 2b ). To describe the potential relationships occurring among bacteria within the gut microbial communities, we further constructed co-occurrence networks of genera from each group based on Spearman correlations. G3, G2, and G1 groups mainly featured three co-occurrence networks with scattered genera from four primary phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria) ( Figure 2c-e ). The correlation between the genera in G1 was distinctly decreased compared with that in G2 and G3. To quantify such differences, we counted the number of edges (connections) and the centrality of nodes (genera) in the two microbial networks. As shown in Figure S1G, the three groups shared four overlapped edges, whereas 36, 172, and 500 of the edges were specific to the G1, G2 and G3, respectively. The closeness and eigenvector of the shared genera in G3 were also quite different from those in G2 and G1 ( Figure 2f ). In general, the above analysis suggested that the microbial ecosystem in G1 was quite different from that in G2 and G3, and that the microbial relationship tended to be homogeneous with aging.

Centralities (rank of the closeness) and discrepancies of nodes in G3, G2 and G1 co-occurrence networks were counted, respectively.
Metagenomic sequencing revealed significant differences in terms of gut microbiota composition and gene function among the three groups
To further explore the role of bacterial species and function in long-lived families, we performed metagenomics sequencing for the three groups. The Shannon index was calculated to quantify the alpha diversity among the three groups at the species level. As shown in  Figure 3a , the alpha diversity was significantly higher in G1 than in G2 and G3, but no difference was found between the G2 and G3. According to the dynamic changes across different age stages ( Figure 3b  and Table S7), the enrichment prevalence of health associated bacteria, e.g.,  Gordonibacter pamelaeae, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, Butyricimonas virosa , and  Bacteroides fragilis  are increased in centenarians. Some potential probiotic bacteria, e.g.,  Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Megamonas funiformis  and  Megamonas hypermegale  are decreased during aging. Bacterial functional analysis based on MetaCyc pathways and gut-brain modules (GBMs) database were shown in  Figure 3c-d  (Table S8). Impressively, we observed significantly decreased enrichment of the L− lysine biosynthesis VI, flavin biosynthesis I and arginine degradation IV pathways in G1 compared with G2 and G3 group, as well as increased enrichment anaerobic energy metabolism and glycine degradation.

To identify the function of specific strain linked to longevity, we performed an analysis of individual draft genomes (bins) through MetaWRAP. 20  A total of 261 acceptable bins (completion greater than 70% and contamination less than 10%) were generated for further analysis (Figure S2a,b and Table S9). A phylogenetic tree of the 261 bins is presented in Figure S2C. The tree is dominated by large numbers of genomes from the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. Given that the relative abundance of  O. splanchnicus  was significantly increased in the centenarians in our study and  O. splanchnicus  strains have been reported to play an important role in centenarians by participating in specific bile acid metabolic activity, 15  we reassembled the strain genome. As shown in  Figure 3e , the  O. splanchnicus  genome consists of a single circular chromosome of 3,788,833 bp containing 182 contigs, an N50 length of 304,00 bp, and a GC content of 43.5%. The genome was near complete (96.77%) and had low evidence of possible contamination (1.08%). The genome encoded a total of 3,622 genes, of which 3,575 genes (98.7%) were protein-coding and 47 genes were RNA-coding. Functional analysis of the  O. splanchnicus  genome showed that it was enriched in the essential amino acid metabolism, protein biosynthesis pathway, and ribosome LSU bacterial pathway ( Figure 3f  and Figure S2D). Impressively, the relationship between  O. splanchnicus  and other microbes in centenarians and young showed a simpler and similar microbial network, however, the elderly group showed a substantially more complicated microbial network ( Figure 4a-d ), which implies that  O. splanchnicus  might play an important role in maintaining younger-like equilibrium of the gut ecosystem in centenarians.

Red links stand for positive interactions between nodes, and green links stand for negative interactions.
Antibiotics overuse is a global public health problem, with the danger of accelerating the spread of drug-resistant bacteria. 21  We analyzed the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of longevity family members, as shown in  Figure 3g-i , no difference in the total ARGs and their subtypes was found, but G1 showed decreased aminoglycosides and vancomycin genes compared with G3 ( Figure 3j-k ), which implicated that the gut microbiota of centenarians was relatively less contaminated with antibiotics.
Gut microbiota–based prediction of three groups
Next, to test whether potential diagnostic biomarkers can be used to predict age groups, we constructed a random forest model based on significant differential genera and MetaCyc pathways. The top 20 significantly differential genera between the G1 and G3 individuals were used as biomarkers to distinguish centenarians from young adults ( Figure 5a, b ). The area under the curve (AUC) displayed good predictive power for longevity in our set (AUC = 0.902). Another Chinese dataset 22  as an external validation set also showed great prediction ability (AUC = 0.826). Similarly, the top 20 significantly different MetaCyc pathways between G1 and G3 showed great discriminatory power to distinguish centenarians from young adults (The current cohort, AUC = 0.92; Sardinian cohort, 5  AUC = 0.745) ( Figure 5c, d ). Meanwhile, the constituted random forest model based on the differential genera between G1 and G2 cannot perform well discriminatory power to predict longevity status, but the discriminant ability based on differential MetaCyc function pathways (acetyl−CoA fermentation to butanoate II, L− isoleucine biosynthesis IV, gluconeogenesis III, pyruvate fermentation to acetone, L− lysine fermentation to acetate and butanoate, and S− adenosyl−L− methionine cycle) still showed great prediction ability (the current cohort, AUC = 0.92; Sardinian cohort, AUC = 0.729;  Figure 5e-h ), which implicating different bacteria may evolve similar metabolic function to involve in aging process.

Enriched species in centenarians associated with decline of immune system, amino acid metabolic activity, and cognitive function
The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of host immunity and brain health. 11  The preservation of host-microbes homeostasis can counteract inflammation, intestinal permeability, and decline in bone and cognitive health. 2  To investigate the association between gut microbiota and inflammatory factors in longevity families, we first analyzed the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in the blood samples of the three age groups (Table S10). As shown in  Figure 6a , we observed the expression of seven cytokines, including IL-6, TGF-β, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-12, IL-33, and IL-1β, showed the highest level in G1 and lowest in G3. However, the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was higher in G1 than in G2 and no significant difference between G1 and G3. Notably, an elevated IL-10 expression in centenarians was observed compared with young and elderly people.

Only the top 20 significantly different species and pathways between G2 and G1 individuals were used to calculate the correlation. In (c-e), only the top 20 significantly different species and MetaCyc pathways between G3 and G1 individuals were used to calculate correlation according to the metagenomic sequencing data. Spearman correlation, *p-value<0.05, **p-value<0.01.
Recent studies have shown that the development of neurons is closely related to the development of gut microbiota. 23  BDNF may take part in regulating neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity to present anti-oxidant effects, suppressing ROS and protecting the mitochondria. 24  Furthermore, Aβ is thought to be a marker of neurological degeneration in the brain. 25  To assess the correction of cognitive function of long-lived people, we analyzed the expression of BDNF and Aβ in the blood of long-lived families. As shown in  Figure 6b , the expression of Aβ gradually increased with age. Nevertheless, BDNF expression showed no significant changes between G1 and G2. The correlation analysis of the significantly different species and immune cytokines showed the abundance of  Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum  in G1 was negatively correlated with IL-6, TGF-β, IL-1β, IL-17, TNF-a, IL-12, and Aβ level and positively associated with BDNF level. Furthermore, we found that the enrichment of  O. splanchnicus, Desulfovibrio piger  and  Victivallis vadensis  in G1 was positively associated with IL-17, TNF-a and IL-12 levels, implicating that these species may be core bacteria that play essential roles in stimulating an increase in these immune factors with aging ( Figure 6c ). To explore the links among metabolic pathways, species, and immune cytokines, we calculated the correlation between two of them. Interestingly, we found that anaerobic energy metabolism and L− isoleucine biosynthesis IV were positively correlated with most immune factors and species, and the level of IL-17, TGF-β, IL-6, IL-12 and Aβ were associated with almost all metabolic pathways ( Figure 6d, e ), indicating alteration of gut microbiota with aging matches metabolic and immune variations. Most of significantly increased species in G1 relative to G2 showed positive correlation with essential amino acids fermentation pathway. Interestingly, the enriched  Bacteroides fragilis  in G1 had no correlation with all of metabolism activity ( Figure 6f  and Figure S2E), in contrast, it showed strong positively correlated with level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 ( Figure 6f ).
The above results further support that gut microbiota might play an essential role in decline of immune system, metabolic activity, and cognitive function during aging.
Identification of stable species in long-lived families
To further understand the importance of changes in microbial strains to phenotypic changes of host individuals, it is crucial to examine the stable and variable genetic components of gut microbiota over time. 13 As human longevity has a strong familial and genetic component, 26  we then hypothesized that longevity families in Bapu village may have core and stable species that do not change with aging. . To investigate the presence of a stable inheritance of bacteria strains in longevity families, we compared the presence of species in 26 longevity families with at least two generations. Only species that exist in at least half of long-lived families and had no significant difference in relative abundance between G3, G2, and G1 groups were defined as stable genetic bacteria. A total of 18 stable species in long-lived families were identified in our study ( Figure 7a ), indicating that these stable species might be involved in the establishment of a new homeostasis with host, thus contributing to longevity. We further compared the relative abundance differences of the 18 species in unrelated young people, elderly people, and centenarians in another Chinese longevity dataset. 22  We found that  Parabacteroides distasonis, Lachnospiraceae bacterium TF01 − 11, Eubacterium Ramulus, Bacteroides stercoris ATCC 43183  and  Bacteroides plebeius  showed significant differences among these unrelated three groups ( Figure 7b ). Impressively, we observed  Eubacterium Ramulus  in another Chinese longevity database showed rejuvenation signature whose abundance was similar in the young and centenarian group and higher than that in the elderly group. Through applying probiotic-based adjunctive treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, Chen et al. found the gut mucosal microbiota of the probiotic-receivers had significantly more beneficial bacteria  E. ramulus  and suggested that the bacteria might alleviate UC symptoms. 27  As changes in single nucleotides can also lead to large changes in the function and pathogenic behavior of bacteria, 28  we further analyzed the changes in bacterial strain level in the three generations of long-lived families, and thus found that more common bacterial strains were shared by individuals of G1 than individuals of G2 and G3 ( Figure 7c-f ). At the phylum level, the total nucleotide diversity in Firmicutes was higher in G1 and G2 than that of G3 ( Figure 7g ), implicating that the bacteria belonging to Firmicutes in the centenarians were more prone to producing bacteria genome mutations. Impressively, the stably inherited bacteria shown in  Figure 6b  such as  Parabacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides stercoris , and  Bacteroides plebeius  showed no significant differences in nucleotide diversity among the three groups ( Figure 7h ). Taken together, the unique stable species in the long-lived families from Baipu village combined its’ validation in another longevity cohorts further suggested that long-lived families in Bapu village might have a specific unchanged microbiota contributing to their longevity.
