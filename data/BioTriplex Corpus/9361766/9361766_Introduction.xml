Gut microbiota and its metabolites play important roles in host’s physiological activities, such as digestion, metabolism, and immunity 1 . In a few regions, centenarians showed specific characteristics of the gut microbiome associated with longevity. 2–5  For example, the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota in Italian centenarians were significantly higher than in younger group. 6  Several studies from different countries and regions reported that healthy centenarians showed higher abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. 6 , 7  Short-chain fatty acids provide the main energy source for colonic epithelial cells and have anti-inflammatory properties. 8  The enrichment of these short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria in centenarians may improve centenarians’ immune function. Consistent with this, a probiotic,  Lactobacillus fermentum PL9988  was found to have a significant advantage in enhancing host immunity, and that has anti-inflammatory and antioxidants effects were most abundant in healthy centenarians in Koran. 9  Taken together, these studies suggested that increased microbiota diversity and an elevated abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria may partially contribute to healthy longevity.
Emerging evidences suggest that gut bacteria collaborate with their animal hosts to modulate the immune, metabolic and nervous systems through dynamic bidirectional communication along the “gut-brain axis”. 10  Changes in the microbial community have been linked to neurological disorders, such as autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. 11  Nevertheless, little evidence has been reported on whether microbial community characteristics in long-lived families are associated with changes in immune factors and cognitive function.
Recently, using two disease models of aging in  Caenorhabditis elegans , reproductive tumor and Alzheimer’s disease, Meng Wang’s group conducted genome-wide screening of  Escherichia coli  mutants and systematically revealed the relationship between individual genes of  E. coli  and host lifespan. The authors found that more than ten probiotic bacterial mutants can not only prolong the lifespan of the host body but also fight against these two different aging-related diseases, and inhibit tumor cell invasion and expansion and amyloid deposition in the host. 12  In agreement with this study, by following up the gut microbiome, 51 human phenotypes and plasma levels of 1,183 metabolites of 338 individuals for 4 years, Chen et al. characterized microbial stability and variation in relation to host physiology. 13  However, whether microbial gene variations serve as microbial signatures of longevity and suggest potential targets to promote healthy aging remains unknown.
At present, the United Nations has awarded ten towns in China for longevity, but only the bacterial community characteristics of the long-lived people in Xinjiang have been primarily reported in Chinese. 14  Several studies about the gut microbiota of longevity people lack detailed analysis on gut microbiota composition, gene variation of bacterial strains, and association with host healthy status. 6 , 7  The samples showed few genetic homogeneity and lifestyle consistency. Rugao City of Jiangsu Province is one of the ten longevity regions, but the characteristics of gut microbiota associated with longevity have not been investigated in this area. To determine globally gut microbiome signatures associated with longevity families, we collected feces and blood samples from 32 families including centenarians, elderly and young people in Baipu Village. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomics data for the cohorts, we first outlined the landscapes of the gut ecosystem in long-lived families in terms of the diversity, microbiome relationship, altered bacteria abundance trajectory along aging, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and function landscape in the gut microbiome along aging. Combined the level of immune inflammatory factors, Amyloid-β (Aβ), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in blood serum across young, elderly and centenarians, we characterized the synergistic changes in gut microbiome associated with decline in neural and immune system with aging.
