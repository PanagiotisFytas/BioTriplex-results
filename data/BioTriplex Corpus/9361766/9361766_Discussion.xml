Microbiota studies involving long-lived families across different age based on families is limited. Our study is unique in that the microbiota samples across three age stages were collected from long-lived families in the same village, and these families have almost similar diet structure, which reduced the interference brought by different environments and diets. We outlined the landscapes of the gut ecosystem in long-lived families from multiple levels including microbial composition, function, relationship profiles, the stable inherited bacteria, single nucleotide polymorphisms of microbial species, and specific bacteria associated with inflammatory factors, BDNF, and Aβ levels. Furthermore, we identified and independently validated bacteria and bacteria-associated function markers that could distinguish centenarians from young and elderly subjects with high accuracy. Taken together, the present microbiome study based on long-lived families provides preliminary insights on aging and longevity associated features including microbiota, neural and immune function.
Previous studies have highlighted mutualistic changes in the composition and diversity of the gut ecosystem of centenarians. 29  For example, Biagi et al. reported the four age groups including semi-supercentenarians (105–109), adults (22–48), and elderly (66–78) showed a good separation on a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), 2  however, our present study showed three age groups have no significant change, indicating long-lived families might share much similar core microbiota composition independent on aging process. Santoro et al. reported that young adults and 70-y-olds maintain a highly similar diversity of gut microbiota, which markedly changes in centenarians. 30  Consistent with this study, we also observed increased species α-diversity in centenarians compared with young adults and elderly people but no significant difference between the elderly and young adults. The result further supports the previous assumption that the diversity of gut microbiota seems to rest in a stable state from G3 to G2, while after 100 y of symbiotic association with the human host, it shows a profound, and possibly adaptive, remodeling. 30  However, due to the present G2 lack of the age gap between 80 and 100 y of age, further analyses are still needed to fill in the age gap and dissect the age-related rebuilding of gut microbiota. In addition, we noted that centenarians showed signs of a typical senile connection between bacteria. Firmicutes are very successful competitors in the gut ecosystem. 31  However, the co-occurrence microbial network around genera from Firmicutes in centenarians showed signs of a typical senile connection of bacteria compared with the young and elderly groups, indicating that the connection of other bacteria from Firmicutes in aging processes may be affected by the loss of bacteria gene function due to the variability caused by single nucleotides mutation in specific bacterial genes.
Kim et al. reported that  Akkermansia  and  Christensenellaceae  are well-known health-associated genera whose abundance increased in centenarians. 32  Biagi et al. suggested that  Christensenellaceae  may represent a signature of the ecosystem of extremely longevity people. 2  However, in the present study, no significant increase in  Akkermansia  and  Christensenellaceae  were observed in centenarians. Several butyrate produced bacteria ( Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, Butyricimonas virosa, Eubacterium ramulus and Bacteroides fragilis ) are increased in centenarians, indicating that our current cohort might possesses bacteria associated with longevity. A recent study provided evidence that  O. splanchnicus  strains which are increased in centenarians can efficiently synthesize isoalloLCA, 15  a specific bile acid that can resist many infections such as  Clostridium difficile  and  Enterococcus faecalis , thereby reducing the risk of infection and assisting in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. In agreement with the report, we observed centenarians showed increased  O. splanchnicus  and younger-like relationship between  O. splanchnicus  and other bacteria. Moreover, our present study showed that  O. splanchnicus  could produce essential amino acids and a positive correlation with L− isoleucine biosynthesis, which indicating  O. splanchnicus  may partially compensated for the decline of essential amino acids caused by aging. Future study based on animal experiments is needed to clarify whether  O. splanchnicus  contribute longevity partially through supplementing essential amino acid.
Age-related dysbiosis is responsible for the age-related increase in systemic inflammation. 33 , 34  Consistent with this, the present study showed that the alteration in gut microbiota observed in centenarians correlate with an increase in most pro-inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood compared with G2 and G3. Significantly, all differential microbial gene function related to essential amino acid biosynthesis in centenarians were depleted and showed negative association with pro-inflammatory factor IL-17 and IL-12. Increasing studies from animal models have shown that a change in the composition and diversity of the microbiota contributes to human health and fitness by modulating the immune inflammation response and vice versa. 35  Impressively, we observed that an increase of anti-inflammatory factor, IL-10 in centenarians compared with the elderly, was associated with an increased abundance of  B. fragilis. B. fragilis  strains can induce the induction of regulatory CD4+ and CD8 + T cells secreting IL-10 to control innate inflammatory responses and mediate beneficial anti-inflammatory effects on inflammatory bowel disease. 36 , 37  Taken together, the result indicated enriched  B. fragilis  in centenarians might promote longevity through modulating anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 expression to mediate the critical balance between health and disease. Moreover, the data indicated that the host immune system may evolve with microbiome to develop complicated mechanisms to modulate the composition of gut microbiota of longevity.
Age-related changes in microbiota composition have been shown to play a role in development of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. 38 , 39  Normal brain aging is usually associated with changes in neural activity, deposition of Aβ and accumulation of tau proteins, leading to gradual cognitive decline in normal older adults. 40  Gut microbiota interacts bidirectionally with the central nervous system through the immune, endocrine, and neural systems generally referred to as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. 41  In our study, we observed a decreased abundance of  B. pseudocatenulatum  in centenarians associated with increased levels of Aβ and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, TNF-a, IL-1β, TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-17. Moya-Pérez et al. reported that  B. pseudocatenulatum  can beneficially modulate the consequences of chronic stress on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, particularly response produced by maternal separation mice model. 42  On the other hand, a growing amount of evidence has pinpointed the availability and metabolism of the essential amino acid, vitamins, and minerals nutrient pattern moderates the effect of brain structure on cognitive function in old age. 43  It is interesting to note that  B. pseudocatenulatum  showed positively associated with essential amino acid pathways such as L− isoleucine biosynthesis I (from threonine) L− valine biosynthesis L− lysine biosynthesis VI. The above information suggests that  B. pseudocatenulatum  can be a particular beneficial bacterium in the improvement of brain function through modulating the availability and metabolism of the essential amino acid as a key regulator of the gut-brain axis.
Notably, IL-17 and Aβ showed the same trend of negative correlation with microbe-related metabolic activity, such as, peptidoglycan maturation, CDP−diacylglycerol biosynthesis, and L− histidine biosynthesis. Increasing evidences showed elevated pro-inflammatory IL-17 were involved in the procession of Aβ accumulation. 44–46  Based on the information, the present study may provide important clues to reveal which bacterial metabolic activity is involved in the underlying mechanisms of the cross-talk between IL-17 and Aβ accumulation. Overall, these findings suggest that longevity may be characterized by a balance among core bacteria and between pro-and anti-inflammatory activity.
