Study population recruitment and statical analysis
32 centenarians (G1, aged 100 to 108 years), 30 elderly (G2, aged 52 to 83 years) and 11 young people (G3, aged 16 to 52 years) were recruited from July 2019 to August 2019 in the Rugao, Nantong, Jiangsu. All participants, who had taken antibiotics, microbial agents, serious diseases or underwent intestinal surgery within half a year before admission were excluded. Among the variables we included, classified variables were expressed as percentages, and continuous variables were expressed as Mean ± SD. We used the Chi-Square test or Fisher exact test to compare classified variables, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to compare continuous variables (SPSS25, USA). All P-values were two-tailed, and  P  < .05 was recognized as statistically significant.
Fecal and blood sample collection
Feces and blood were collected at subjects’ homes. The feces were collected in 10 mL sterile container and delivered immediately at low temperatures. The frozen feces were shipped using dry ice overnight to Nanjing Medical University. Once received, fecal samples were divided into three parts of 200 mg and stored at −80°C until extraction. The blood was used coagulation tubes to collect, and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm and the supernatant serum was frozen and stored at −80°C until analysis.
Blood serum elisa analysis
Eight immune cytokines including IL-6, TGF-β, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-12, IL-33, and IL-1β, amyloid β-protein (Aβ), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), following the company’s kit procedures (Ruixinbio Quanzhou, China). The level of immune cytokines in the serum of blood among three groups were statistically analyzed by GraphPad Prism software, respectively.
DNA isolation and 16S rRNA gene sequencing
In total, 0.18–0.22 g stool samples were used to extract total bacteria DNA following the protocol of the DNA extraction kit (#DP328, Tiangen Company, Beijing, China). The 16S rRNA V4 regions were performed using specific primers 515 F GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA and 806 R GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT. Sequencing libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA) with following manufacturer recommendations, and index codes were added. Sequencing was performed in the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform (Novogene, China).
Microbiome bioinformatics were performed with QIIME2 2021.4. 47  Shannon index for alpha diversity and Bray-Curtis for beta diversity measures. Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) were analyzed using the vegan v2.5–7 R package. Taxonomy was assigned to ASVs using the qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn. Naive Bayes classifiers trained on Silva 138 99% OTUs from 515 F/806 R region of sequences. Gene functions analysis were predicted as previous method. 48  Predicted functions were calibrated for all of samples (n = 73) using Meta-Apo 49  based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Thirty paired metagenomic samples were used for training.
Shotgun sequencing for metagenomics
Sequence libraries were generated using NEBNext® Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA). The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform (insert size 350 bp, read length 150 bp) at the Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).
Raw sequence reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.39 to remove adapters and low-quality regions and then removed of contaminating human reads using Bowtie2 v2.4.2 (Reference database: GRCh38). 50  The taxonomic composition was profiled using the default parameters of MetaPhlAn3 v3.0.9. 51  The functional gene pathway was profiled using the default settings of HUMAnN3 v3.0.0.alpha.3. 52  Functional potential profiling of microbial communities was performed by HUMAnN3 using pangenomes annotated with UniRef90 on all species detectable per sample with MetaPhlAn3. Functional annotations rely on the MetaCyc database and gut-brain modules (GBMs) database.
Sequence assembly and genome binning
After removal of host reads, the sequence data per sample were assembled individually using Megahit v1.1.3 included in MetaWRAP v1.3.2. 20  Bowtie2 v2.4.2 50  was used to map reads back to the assembled contigs. Then, metagenomic binning was applied to both single-sample assemblies and the co-assemblies using CONCOCT v1.0.0, MaxBin2 v2.2.6, and metaBAT2 v2.12.1. Next, all bins were aggregated and dereplicated using dRep v3.2.0. For the final bins, CheckM v1.0.12 was used to estimate the genome completeness and contamination. The draft metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) with completeness ≥70% and contamination ≤10% were retained for the subsequent analyses. The alignment results are then used by taxator-kt to estimate the most likely taxonomy of each contig. The metaWRAP::Annotate_bins module takes in a set of bins and quickly functionally annotates them with PROKKA v1.13. 53  Using DIAMOND v0.9.24, 54  all protein predictions were searched against the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) database 55  using dbCAN2. 56  To estimate the genetic relationships among all bins, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built based on a concatenated protein sequence alignment using the package PhyloPhlAn 3.0.60. 57  The taxonomic and phylogenetic information were then combined and visualized by ggtree v2.4.2. 58  Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) 59  was used to predict function of MAGs.
Absolute abundance analysis according to the 16S rRNA data
Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction (ANCOM-BC) 60  was used to calculate absolute abundance according to the 16S rRNA data.
Co-occurrence microbial network analysis
To understand the correlations among different genera, we constructed co-occurrence network based on the 16S rRNA data. The bacterial correlations in the G3, G2, and G1 samples were analyzed, respectively. Then, the co-occurrence networks were constructed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient value based on the relative abundance of each genus. The significant correlated genus (Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected P value < .05, rho ≥ 0.7) were visualized by Cytoscape v3.8.2. Closeness centrality of the shared nodes were calculated by igraph R package. Only genera existed in at least 20% sample were included in the network analysis.
Interdependent functional groups (guilds)
Bacterial species in the human gut may also survive, adapt, and decline as interdependent functional groups, which are regarded as guilds responding to environmental perturbations. 18  Co-abundance analysis can help identify such groups. The ASVs shared by at least 20% among all the samples were considered as prevalent ASVs. Correlations between prevalent ASVs were calculated using the SparCC algorithm based on their abundance. 61  The correlation values were converted to a correlation distance (1-correlation value), and the ASVs were clustered using the Ward clustering algorithm. The guilds were determined by dividing the cluster tree using permutational MANOVA (9999 permutations, P < .001). Permutational MANOVA was performed using vegan R package. And the guilds network was visualized in Cytoscape.
Random forest model prediction
RandomForest v4.6–14 R package was used to build classification models using profiles of genera or pathways with significant differences between G3 and G1 or between G2 and G1. The evaluation of the random forest classification models was performed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the area under curve (AUC) was used to assess the ROC effect, the closer the AUC to 1, the better the model performance. 62  Internal validation used 5-fold cross-validation based on our cohort. External validation used our cohort as training set and another dataset as test set. The importance of markers being used to build classification models were calculated by randomForest v4.6–14 with options importance = TRUE.
Correlation analysis of species, serum cytokines and pathways
To determine the association between species, cytokines and pathways in G3, G2 and G1 groups, we constructed a correlation analysis using Spearman’s correlations (Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected P value < .05) in psych R package. The results were visualized by networkD3 and pheatmap R packages.
Nucleotide diversity analysis
InStrain, 62  a program that uses metagenomic paired reads to profile intra-population genetic diversity (microdiversity) across whole genomes, was used to explore nucleotide diversity of the same species. InStrain considers both major and minor alleles during genomic comparison. The microdiversity-aware average nucleotide identity (ANI) metric is referred to as ‘population ANI (popANI)’ which is a new term to describe a unique type of ANI calculation performed by inStrain that considers both major and minor alleles. A threshold of 99.9% popANI was chosen as the threshold to define bacterial as the same strain. We run inStrain using the UHGG genome collection. The links drawn for each strain shared between G3 individuals, G2 individuals and G1 individuals, respectively, were visualized using circlize v0.4.13 R package.
Resistance gene annotations
The predicated antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were searched by ARGs-OAP v2.0 63  based on the CARD, ARDB and NCBI-NR databases. ARGs-OAP v2.0 improves cell number quantification by using the average coverage of essential single copy marker genes.
