Cell Culture, Transfection, and Validation
NSC-34 cells were used as previously described ( Ryan et al., 2009 ) and were the gift of Dr. Heather Durham, (Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC). MDA-MB-468 cells were obtained from ATCC. Cells were grown in a 5% CO 2  incubator at 37°C. NSC-34 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) ( Cashman et al., 1992 ). MDA-MB-468 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. Stable transfectants that express human PGRN (NSC-34 and MDA-MB-468 cells), were generated by transfection with human PGRN (pcDNA3-hPGRN) or pcDNA3 for empty vector control transfections. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and selected with G418 (400 μg/ml) for 4–6 weeks according to manufacturer’s instructions. To generate cells that stably express ShRNA-mPGRN, NSC-34 cells were transfected with shRNA constructs that were designed by OriGene Technologies using murine  Grn  specific 29 nucleotide stretches within the coding region. NSC-34 cells were seeded onto 6 well plates and then transfected with shRNA-mPGRN (pRS/shPGRN), or control vector (pRS vector alone, Origene Technologies), using Fugene (Roche) when the cultures were 80% confluent. Stable transfectants were selected by culturing in medium containing puromycin (7 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) for 6 weeks according to manufacturer’s instructions. To prevent phenotypic drift, stocks of the original transfectants were frozen in liquid N 2  and reanimated at regular intervals.
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was performed with Revert-aid reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific). Human and mouse PGRN specific primer sets were designed to amplify species specific products. See  Supplementary Table 1  for the sequences of the PCR primers. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) program consisted of denaturation for 2 min at 94°C; 35 cycles at 94°C, 30 s; 55°C, 30 s; 72°C, 30 s; and a final extension of 5 min at 72°C. PCR was performed using Taq DNA Polymerase (Bio-Basic).
Western Blot Analysis
Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Sigma) mixed with Complete Protease inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science, 1 tablet for 7 ml buffer) was used to lyse and extract proteins from NSC-34 cells. Protein lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min, briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were quantified for protein content and equal amounts were mixed with 2× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins on the gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked over-night with membrane blocking agent (GE Healthcare) or non-fat milk (Thermo Scientific) at 4°C. The blots were incubated with 1:250 anti-human PGRN polyclonal antibody (rabbit anti-human PGRN generated in our laboratory) or 1:10000 anti-human PGRN (R&D system) for 1 h in blocking buffer followed by extensive washing. After incubating with an anti-rabbit or anti–mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:4,000) at room temperature for 1 h and blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Other antibodies used were 1:1000 anti-Ret (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-phospho Ret (abcam), 1:2000 anti-EGFR, anti-phosphoEGFR, anti-ErbB2, anti-phosphoErbB2 (R&D systems). Protein loading controls were performed by stripping the membrane and probing with mouse monoclonal β-actin antibody (AC-40; Sigma) at a dilution of 1:1000.
Morphometric Analysis
Cells were plated in 6 well plates at 7000 cells per well containing DMEM with 10% FBS. After 24 h, the media was replaced with DMEM containing 0% FBS, 1% FBS, or 10% FBS. The cultures were monitored for 25 days, and photographs were acquired using an inverted phase contrast microscope. The photographs were analyzed using ImageJ ( Schindelin et al., 2012 ) by enabling the “Area” and “Shape” descriptors, and “Perimeter” and “Feret’s diameter” measurements ( Rasband, 1977 ). Feret’s diameteris the longest distance between any two points along the selection boundary ( Ferreira and Rasband, 2012 ), sometimes also called the “caliper length,” and is a measure of asymmetry. The neurite-like projections were measured using the NeuronJ plugin. 1  This facilitates the tracing and quantification of neurite extension using the software ImageJ ( Meijering et al., 2004 ;  Meijering, 2010 ).
Neurite Extension Assay
Cells were cultured in 12 well plates coated with nitrocellulose which was prepared by dissolving 5 cm 2  of nitrocellulose (membrane 0.22 um, Bio basic) in 6 ml of methanol. Briefly 0.1 ml aliquots of this solution were rapidly spread over the surface of each well in 12 well plate and allowed to dry under a laminar flow hood as described in  Lagenaur and Lemmon (1987) . PGRN was applied in 3 μl droplets containing 100 μg/ml. After one minute, the droplets were removed gently using a pipette. The plates were then blocked by washing twice with 2 ml of culture media (DMEM with 10% FBS) for 10 min each. NSC- 34 cells were cultured on the nitrocellulose coated plates at the concentration of 6000 cells per ml in 2 ml medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 2 days. The neurite length was measured using ImageJ by tracing the neurite-like projections.
Statistics for Neurite Extension and Morphometric Analyses
Statistical significance among experimental groups was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s Multiple Comparisons Test ( p  < 0.001- *** ,  p  < 0.01- ** ,  p  < 0.05-*) using GraphPad software (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Error bars represent s.e.m.
Transcriptomics Analysis
NSC-34/shPGRN, NSC-34/hPGRN, or control constructs were cultured in T75 flasks. They were sub-cultured in four replicates. NSC-34 cells (200,000) from each of 12 flasks were plated in T25 flasks with serum. After 24 h the media containing 10% serum was removed and replaced with media containing 5% serum. After a further 24 h the media was changed to one containing 1% serum. 24 h later cells were lysed in Trizol and total RNA was extracted. The RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop chip. cDNA synthesis was carried out using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Scientific). Following cDNA synthesis reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to confirm over/under expression of PGRN as indicated earlier. Reduced levels of mPGRN were noticed in all shPGRN constructs and expression of hPGRN was detected only in the over-expressors as expected. The over/under expression of PGRN levels were further confirmed by Western blot as mentioned previously.
The RNA quality/integrity was analyzed using a Nano ChiP Bioanalyzer. The gene expression profile was determined using Illumina Mouse Whole-Genome Expression BeadChips (MouseWG-6 v2.0, multiple 12 samples) at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre. The data replicates were validated by principal component analysis which confirmed that all 4 replicates from the same construct segregate together and separately from the other constructs. The lumi normalization followed by an empirical Bayesian, EB ( Wright and Simon, 2003 ) algorithm was applied to the data using FlexArray 1.6.1 software (available at  http://gqinnovationcenter.com/services/bioinformatics/flexarray/tutorials.aspx?l=e ) to identify genes that were either significantly reduced or induced in the PGRN over/under expressing NSC-34 cells compared to controls. The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.8 ( Huang da et al., 2009b , a ) was employed to provide tables of enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms and predicted functional pathways based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Gene networks were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway analysis software (IPA). IPA is a web-based bioinformatics application that allows data analysis from microarray experiments by identifying related proteins within a pathway. 1.5-fold enrichment or depletion of transcript signal was used as the cut-off ( Kramer et al., 2014 ). Additional functional assignments for individual genes were obtained manually by searching for their entries in Uniprot, 2  Genecards 3  and On-line Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM 4 ). Gene expression data was submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public repository, accession number:  GSE185877 .
Lipidomic Analysis
Lipidomics and Proteomics mass spectrometric analyses were performed by the Proteomics Technology Platform, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal (manager Lorne Taylor). NSC-34/shPGRN or NSC-34/hPGRN cells were cultured in T75 flasks in DMEM with 1% FBS. Cells were collected by trypsinization at about 70% confluency. Three independent extractions and mass spectrometric analyses were performed. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 1 ml and cell numbers were determined. Twenty million cells from each sample were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min and incubated with 150 μl methanol and 500 μl Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE, Fisher Scientific) for 2 h on a rocker at room temperature. Phase-separation was performed by adding 125 μl of MS grade water (Fisher Scientific). After 10 min incubation at room temperature each sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The upper organic phase was collected, and the lower phase was re-extracted by adding methanol, MTBE, and water. Both fractions were combined, dried using a SpeedVac lyophilizer and were introduced into the TripleTOF™ 5600 System by direct infusion using the Nanospray III source and an Eksigent NanoLC Ultra and Autosampler at a flow rate of 1 μL/min. The data were analyzed using peak view Software and lipid identification and quantification was done in lipid view Software.
Proteomics Analysis
NSC-34/ShPGRN, NSC-34-/hPGRN, or vector controls were cultured in T75 flasks in DMEM with 1% FBS until about 80% confluency. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed by homogenizing in solution containing 20 mM HEPES, 150 nM NaCl, and 0.320M sucrose. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. Samples were normalized for input by cell numbers and subsequently by total peptides using the Scaffold program (see below) at the data analysis stage. For each sample, proteins were loaded onto a single stacking gel band to remove lipids, detergents and salts. The gel band was reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetic acid and digested with trypsin. Extracted peptides were re-solubilized in 0.1% aqueous formic acid and loaded onto a Thermo Acclaim Pepmap (Thermo, 75 uM ID × 2 cm C18 3 uM beads) precolumn and then onto an Acclaim Pepmap Easyspray (Thermo, 75 uM × 15 cm with 2 uM C18 beads) analytical column separation using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 uHPLC at 230 nl/min with a gradient of 2–35% organic (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 3 h. Peptides were analyzed using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer operating at 120,000 resolution (FWHM in MS1) with HCD sequencing (15,000 resolution) at top speed for all peptides with a charge of 2+or greater. The raw data were converted into *.mgf format (Mascot generic format) for searching using the Mascot 2.6.2 search engine (Matrix Science) against mouse protein sequences (Uniprot 2018). The database search results were loaded onto Scaffold Q+ Scaffold_4.8.9 (Proteome Sciences) for statistical treatment and data visualization. Proteomics data was submitted to MassIVE public repository by participating in ProteomeXchange, accession number:  MSV000088451 . The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.8 ( Huang da et al., 2009b , a ) was employed to analyze Gene Ontology (GO) as above using a 1.2-fold change cut-off and  p  < 0.05.
Membrane Protein Interactomics of Progranulin by Ligand Receptor Capture
Ligand receptor capture (LRC) identifies the interactions of extracellular soluble proteins with membrane proteins in live cells by making use of a biotinylated trifunctional reagent TRICEPS ( Frei et al., 2012 ). All reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. 300 μg PGRN (R&D Systems), or insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) as the positive control, were coupled to 1.5 μl TRICEPS by an amide linkage. The second functional group of the TRICEPS reagent, a protected hydrazine, reacts with aldehydes on the glycan side chains of the target receptor proteins. As aldehydes are not typically present on the cell surface, they are first generated by mild sodium metaperiodate oxidation using 6 × 10 8  NSC-34 cells. The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and washed once with 1× PBS then in DMEM without serum for 30 min prior to cells collection. The LRC reaction was initiated by incubating mildly oxidized and washed living cells with 50 μl of the PGRN-TRICEPS conjugate, or 50 μl of Insulin-TRICEPS for 90 min at 4°C during which time PGRN-TRICEPS or insulin-TRICEPS reacts covalently through hydrazine coupling to the glycan chains of any cell surface membrane protein to which it binds. The cells were lysed, digested with trypsin and the TRICEPS labeled peptides recovered by biotin affinity using streptavidin beads. For mass spectrometry the streptavidin-purified peptides were de-glycosylated using PNGaseF, an enzyme which cuts between the proximal  N -acetylglucosamine of the glycan side chain and the glycopeptide asparagine in the N-X-S/T glycosylation site motif (N stands for asparagine, X is any amino acid except proline and S/T is serine or threonine). The PNGase reaction deamidates the asparagine and modifies the N-X-S/T glycosylation motif to a D-X-S/T motif (where D is aspartic acid), the corresponding mass shift being used to identify peptides that were crosslinked by the PGRN or Insulin-TRICEPS conjugates. The TRICEPS labeled peptide recovery and the mass spectrometric analyses were performed by DualSystems Biotech. The samples were analyzed on a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap XL spectrometer. Peptide identifications were filtered to a false-discovery rate of ≤1% and quantified using an MS1-based label-free approach. For the MS1 quantification, the non-linear DYNAMICS Progenesis QI for proteomics was used. The experiment was done in triplicate. All six samples, PGRN and insulin control, showed an alignment score of >90%. Therefore, none of the six samples had to be excluded from statistical analysis. The Data is presented as a volcano plot where all the membrane proteins that crosslinked to either PGRN or the insulin control fall as statistical outliers on either arm of the plot. Positive detection of the insulin receptor control signal confirms that the TRICEPs reaction worked under the conditions used, and that there was no protein denaturation. Non-specific binding is accounted for as signals that are statistically indistinguishable between the insulin and progranulin arms of the experiment. Possible interactions among proteins identified in these assays was performed using the STRING program (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) ( Szklarczyk et al., 2019 ).
Phospho-Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Antibody Array
The proteome profiler mouse or human Phospho-Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK) antibody array membranes (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were incubated with NSC-34 or MDA-MB-468 cell lysates and processed as per the manufacturer’s protocol using a Phosphotyrosine specific antibody. In brief, approximately 3 × 10 7  cells of NSC-34/shPGRN cells expressing reduced PGRN, NSC-34/hPGRN cells overexpressing PGRN and WT NSC-34 control, MDA-MB-468 WT and PGRN expressing cells were cultured in serum free medium overnight. After incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and lysed with lysis buffer containing aprotonin/leupeptin (10 μg/mL each) for 30 min, centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were collected and stored at –80 degrees A protein assay (BioRad Biotechnologies, Hercules, CA) was performed before incubating with the RTK membranes to normalize loadings.
