In the present study, we found that MSC-Exos effectively alleviated UUO-induced renal fibrosis. Importantly, we demonstrated for the first time that MSC-Exos ameliorated renal fibrosis by attenuating glycolysis in TECs. Further studies showed that the antiglycolytic effects of MSC-Exos were achieved miR-21a-5p-mediated targeting of PFKM (Fig.  7 ). Fig. 7 Schematic diagram of the effects of MSC-Exos on glycolysis and renal fibrosis. In the process of renal fibrosis, TECs undergo a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis, and MSC-Exos are able to attenuate renal fibrosis by inhibiting glycolysis in TECs via the miR-21a-5p/PFKM pathway.

Renal fibrosis is the common pathological outcome of almost all chronic kidney diseases and indicates a poor prognosis. Cytotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of renal fibrosis, in which MSCs have played an increasingly important role [ 20 ]. Accumulating evidence shows that MSCs exert pleiotropic effects, mainly in a paracrine manner [ 10 ,  21 ]. MSC-derived exosomes have emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of renal fibrosis due to their antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic effects [ 22 – 24 ]. In the present study, we identified a novel role for MSC-Exos in renal fibrosis, in which MSC-Exos alleviate renal fibrosis by inhibiting glycolysis in TECs. Although previous studies have shown that MSC-Exos may inhibit glycolysis in other diseases [ 16 ,  17 ], this is the first report suggesting that MSC-Exos may exert an antiglycolytic effect in renal fibrosis.
TECs are highly metabolically active cells with reabsorption, water-electrolyte maintenance and acid-base balance functions. Healthy TECs rely on fatty acids to meet their energy demands. However, under stimuli, such as ischemia, obstruction and drugs, fatty acid oxidation malfunctions in TECs [ 25 ,  26 ]. Fatty acid oxidation dysfunction is generally accompanied by intracellular lipid deposition and a shift in cellular metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis. Cao et al. demonstrated that TECs utilizes glycolysis to provide energy during kidney fibrosis [ 18 ]. Although aerobic glycolysis provides energy and substrates for the proliferation of TECs, it also promotes the progression of renal fibrosis. Cai et al. found that a metabolic switch from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis occurs in patients with diabetic nephropathy [ 27 ]. As expected, we found that the gene and protein levels of glycolysis-related enzymes were significantly upregulated in murine fibrotic kidneys, and we found a marked increase in lactate concentration, confirming a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis in renal fibrosis. In addition, we further found that this metabolic shift occurred mainly in TECs. TGF-β1, which is a potent profibrotic factor, a metabolic regulator and a potent activator of glycolysis, promotes glycolysis by directly inducing the expression of glycolytic enzymes, such as HK and PFK [ 28 ,  29 ]. Moreover, TGF-β1 inhibits the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A by stabilizing HIF-1α, which in turn activates PDK1, thereby indirectly promoting glycolysis [ 30 ]. Previous studies have shown that TGF-β1 induces glycolysis in TECs [ 18 ,  19 ]. Consistent with these studies, we found that TGF-β1 not only promoted the expression of HK2 and PFKFB3 but also significantly increased the ECAR and lactate concentration in TCMK-1 cells. More importantly, MSC-Exos alleviated glycolysis in TECs both in vivo and in vitro.
miRNAs are a class of endogenous noncoding single-stranded RNA molecules with a length of approximately 22 nucleotides that are widely found in eukaryotes, and they perform important roles in organism development, cell differentiation and homeostasis [ 31 – 33 ]. Recent studies have demonstrated that MSC-Exos exert protective effects through miRNAs in multiple kidney diseases [ 34 – 36 ]. Therefore, we speculated that certain miRNAs contained in exosomes may be involved in the alleviation of renal fibrosis. As expected, we found that miR-6236 and miR-21a-5p were enriched in MSC-Exos by miRNA sequencing. Further investigation found that miR-21a-5p but not miR-6236 was significantly elevated in the kidney after treatment with MSC-Exos. miR-21a-5p, which is located on chromosome 11 and has a length of 22 nucleotides, has been shown to play a positive regulatory role in a variety of diseases. Luther et al. validated that MSC-Exos attenuates myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury by inhibiting the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes via miR-21a-5p [ 37 ]. Xin et al. demonstrated that EVs derived from MSCs regulate the polarization of microglia and macrophages by delivering miR-21a-5p, thereby mitigating hypoxic-ischemic injury [ 38 ]. In agreement with these studies, we found that knockdown of miR-21a-5p exacerbated glycolysis in TECs and renal fibrosis, while overexpression of miR-21a-5p significantly attenuated this effect, suggesting that miR-21a-5p is essential for renoprotection. Mechanistically, miR-21a-5p binds to the 3’UTR of PFKM to suppress its expression. PFKM is the second rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, catalyzing an irreversible reaction and serving an essential regulatory role in glycolysis [ 39 ,  40 ]. Taken together, the present findings revealed that MSC-Exos are involved in the regulation of glycolysis through the miR-21a-5p/PFKM signaling pathway, thereby ameliorating renal fibrosis.
The present study had several limitations. First, we focused on the regulatory role of MSC-Exos on glycolysis without further exploring the alterations of oxidative phosphorylation or fatty acid oxidation in the kidney. Second, we only investigated the regulatory role of miR-21a-5p on glycolysis in the present study, and other targets of miR-21a-5p or other miRNAs may also exert nephroprotective effects via other modalities. We speculate that miRNAs may function in different pathophysiological processes in addition to glycolysis to alleviate renal fibrosis. Further experiments are warranted to elaborate on these issues.
Taken together, the present results demonstrated that MSC-Exos ameliorates renal fibrosis by attenuating the glycolysis of TECs through miR-21a-5p-mediated targeting of PFKM. These findings identified a novel mechanism of MSC-Exos in renal repair, which may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for renal fibrosis.
