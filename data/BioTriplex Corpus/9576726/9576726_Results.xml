Isolation and identification of MSC-Exos
After being cultured as described in the Materials and Methods, bone marrow MSCs were identified by morphology, multilineage differentiation abilities and surface markers. MSCs showed a typical spindle-like morphology by optical microscopy (Fig. S 1A ). The adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was identified by Oil Red O and Alizarin Red staining, respectively (Fig. S 1B ). Flow cytometry revealed that MSCs were positive for CD29 and CD44 but negative for CD31 and CD117 (Fig. S 1C ).
Exosomes were characterized by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and western blot analysis. TEM showed that MSC-Exos displayed a round-shaped morphology of approximately 100 nm with a typical bilayer membrane structure (Fig.  1A  and S 2A ). The peak diameter of the particles was 103 nm, and the median diameter was 137.2 nm as assessed by NTA (Fig.  1B  and S 2B ). Western blot analysis indicated that MSC-Exos expressed exosome-related proteins, such as CD9, CD63, and TSG101, while calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum marker, was absent in MSC-Exos (Fig.  1C  and S 5A ).

MSC-Exos alleviate UUO-induced renal fibrosis in mice
To investigate the therapeutic effects of MSC-Exos on renal fibrosis, we established a mouse model of renal fibrosis induced by UUO. Mice were administered low-dose MSC-Exos (L-Exos; 50 μg), high-dose MSC-Exos (H-Exos; 100 μg), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via tail vein injection immediately after resuscitation. Compared to the sham group, UUO resulted in atrophy of TECs, loss of brush borders and significant dilatation of the tubular lumen, and these UUO-induced effects were ameliorated by MSC-Exos in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.  2A ). Sirius red and immunohistochemistry staining showed that MSC-Exos markedly reduced the deposition of collagenous fibers and extracellular matrix (ECM) in the renal interstitium (Fig.  2B, C ). Fig. 2 MSC-Exos alleviate UUO-induced renal fibrosis in mice. A  Tubular injury was assessed by H&E staining ( n  = 5 mice per group; scale bar=100 μm).  B  Deposition of collagenous fibers in the renal interstitium was evaluated by Sirius Red staining ( n  = 5 mice per group; scale bar=100 μm).  C  Immunohistochemistry staining of fibronectin in kidney tissues ( n  = 5 mice per group; scale bar=100 μm).  D  Immunohistochemistry staining of α-SMA in kidney tissues ( n  = 5 mice per group; scale bar=100 μm). Representative images from one experiment out of three are shown.  E  Protein levels of fibronectin and collagen I in kidney tissues were assessed by western blot analysis ( n  = 3 mice per group). Data are presented as the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.  * p  < 0.05,  ** p  < 0.01 and  *** p  < 0.001. Mice were injected with MSC-Exos (50 µg or 100 µg) or PBS on Day 0 after UUO induction. Renal tissues from sham, UUO, L-Exos or H-Exo-treated mice were sampled on Day 7 after UUO induction. 
Because aberrant proliferation of myofibroblasts is a typical characteristic of renal fibrosis, we examined alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a marker of myofibroblasts, to assess the effect of MSC-Exos on the activation of myofibroblasts. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that the expression of α-SMA was reduced after MSC-Exos treatment, which indicated that MSC-Exos inhibited the activation of myofibroblasts (Fig.  2D ). Western blot analysis revealed that the levels of ECM proteins, such as fibronectin and collagen I, were decreased after treatment with MSC-Exos (Fig.  2E  and S 5B ). These results suggested that MSC-Exos alleviate UUO-induced murine renal fibrosis.
MSC-Exos attenuate glycolysis in tubular epithelial cells
Metabolic reprogramming to aerobic glycolysis is a feature of renal fibrosis. Therefore, we investigated whether MSC-Exos interfere with glycolysis in renal fibrosis. MSC-Exos (100 μg) were administered intravenously to test this hypothesis. As expected, MSC-Exos markedly downregulated the expression of glycolysis-related enzymes, such as hexokinase 2 (HK2) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 1 (PFKFB1) (Fig. S 3A ). Furthermore, the decreased levels of HK2 and PFKFB3 induced by MSC-Exos were confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig.  3A  and S 5C ). Because lactate is the final metabolite of the glycolytic process, we assayed the concentration of lactate in renal tissues. The lactate level of fibrotic kidneys was significantly reduced after MSC-Exo treatment (Fig.  3B ). Subsequently, immunohistochemistry staining was performed to identify the site where glycolysis occurs in the kidney, which revealed that HK2 was predominantly expressed in TECs, suggesting that a metabolic switch to glycolysis occurs in TECs during renal fibrosis (Fig.  3C ). Fig. 3 MSC-Exos attenuate glycolysis in tubular epithelial cells. A  The expression of HK2 and PFKFB3 in renal tissues was measured by western blot analysis ( n  = 3 mice per group).  B  The lactate concentration of kidney tissue homogenates was quantified by a lactate assay kit ( n  = 5 mice per group).

D  Protein levels of HK2 and PFKFB3 in TCMK-1 cells were assessed by western blot analysis ( n  = 3).  E  Lactate concentration in the supernatant of TCMK-1 cells was assayed by a lactate assay kit ( n  = 4).  F  Real-time ECAR of PBS-, TGF-β1-, and MSC-Exo-treated TCMK-1 cells was determined by a Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer ( n  = 6). Data are presented as the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.  * p  < 0.05,  ** p  < 0.01 and  *** p  < 0.001. MSC-Exos (100 µg) or PBS was administered intravenously on Day 0 after UUO induction. Kidneys were isolated from sham, UUO and MSC-Exo-treated mice on Day 7. TCMK-1 cells were incubated with TGF-β1 with or without MSC-Exos (20 µg). Cells and cell supernatants were collected at 48 h. 
Given that glycolysis takes place mainly in TECs in the process of renal fibrosis, we investigated whether MSC-Exos alleviate glycolysis in TECs ex vivo. We established a glycolysis model in the mouse TEC line, TCMK-1, induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) as previous studies have demonstrated that TGF-β1 induces glycolysis in TECs [ 18 ,  19 ]. As expected, TGF-β1 significantly increased the expression of HK2 and PFKFB1 in TCMK-1 cells, while MSC-Exos diminished their levels (Fig. S 3B ). Western blot analysis revealed that the levels of HK2 and PFKFB3 were reduced after treatment with MSC-Exos (Fig.  3D  and S 5D ). Similarly, the lactate concentration of the cell supernatants was decreased after treatment with MSC-Exos (Fig.  3E ). To further investigate the effect of MSC-Exos on glycolysis, we assessed the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of TCMK-1 cells with a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer as ECAR indirectly reflects the glycolytic capacity of cells. The results showed that the ECAR of TCMK-1 cells induced by TGF-β1 was markedly elevated, which was significantly diminished by MSC-Exos (Fig.  3F ). Collectively, these findings suggested that MSC-Exos alleviate glycolysis in TECs both in vivo and in vitro.
MSC-Exos attenuate glycolysis in tubular epithelial cells by inhibiting PFKM through miR-21a-5p
Because exosomes regulate many physiological activities through miRNAs, we investigated whether MSC-Exos regulate glycolysis via miRNAs by analyzing the exosomal miRNA expression profiles of MSC-Exos by miRNA sequencing. The top five most abundant miRNAs in MSC-Exos were miR-6236, miR-21a-5p, miR-143-3p, miR-1934 and miR-29a-3p, accounting for approximately 70% of the total miRNA reads (Fig.  4A, B ). We next detected the expression of the top five miRNAs in MSC-Exos. miR-21a-5p was highly expressed in MSC-Exos as determined by qPCR (Fig.  4C ). To investigate whether miRNAs were involved in the renoprotective effects of MSC-Exos and which miRNAs played a role, we further measured the expression of these miRNAs in MSC-Exo-treated kidney tissues. MSC-Compared to the sham and UUO groups, Exos significantly upregulated the expression of miR-21a-5p (Fig.  4D ). Fig. 4 miR-21a-5p is enriched in MSC-Exos.

C  qPCR analysis of the top 5 miRNAs in MSC-Exos ( n  = 4).  D  Relative expression of the top 5 miRNAs in MSC-Exos in kidney tissues from sham, UUO and MSC-Exo-treated mice ( n  = 4 mice per group). Data are presented as the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.  ** p  < 0.01.
To explore the role of miR-21a-5p, we predicted the potential target genes of miR-21a-5p that may be involved in the glycolytic process through the miRDB and TargetScan databases. Both databases suggested that PFKM is a potential target gene of miR-21a-5p (Fig.  5A ). To confirm the association between miR-21a-5p and PFKM, we conducted a luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression of miR-21a-5p significantly decreased the activity of the wild-type (WT) PFKM 3’ untranslated region (UTR) luciferase reporter. However, the activity of the mutant (MUT) PFKM 3’UTR luciferase reporter was not significantly altered (Fig.  5B ), indicating that PFKM is a target gene of miR-21a-5p.

G  ECAR of TGF-β1-, NC-Exo-, miR-21a-5p inhibitor -Exo- and miR-21a-5p mimic -Exo-treated TCMK-1 cells ( n  = 6). Data are presented as the mean ± SD from three independent experiments.  ** p  < 0.01 and  *** p  < 0.001.
To investigate the role of miR-21a-5p in MSC-Exos, MSCs were transfected with a miR-21a-5p inhibitor and miR-21a-5p mimic. Compared to the negative control (NC) inhibitor or control group, transfection with the miR-21a-5p inhibitor significantly reduced the level of miR-21a-5p, while transfection of miR-21a-5p mimic significantly upregulated the expression of miR-21a-5p (Fig.  5C ). Exosomes of miR-21a-5p mimic-transfected MSCs (miR-21a-5p mimic -Exos) and miR-21a-5p inhibitor-transfected MSCs (miR-21a-5p inhibitor -Exos) were subsequently isolated from cell supernatants. NC-Exos significantly decreased the expression of PFKM in TCMK-1 cells treated with TGF-β1, which was reversed by treatment with miR-21a-5p inhibitor -Exos (Fig.  5D , S 4 , and S 5E ). The expression of other glycolysis-related enzymes was also significantly upregulated by miR-21a-5p inhibitor -Exos, while miR-21a-5p mimic -Exos further inhibited glycolysis in TCMK-1 cells compared to the NC-Exo group (Fig.  5E  and S 5F ). Moreover, treatment with miR-21a-5p inhibitor -Exos increased the lactate concentration of TCMK-1-cell supernatants compared to NC-Exos, whereas miR-21a-5p mimic -Exos eliminated this effect (Fig.  5F ). Consistently, the ECAR of the TCMK-1 cells was significantly increased in the miR-21a-5p inhibitor -Exos group compared to the NC-Exos and miR-21a-5p mimic -Exos group (Fig.  5G ). Taken together, these results indicated that MSC-Exos attenuate glycolysis in TECs by inhibiting PFKM through miR-21a-5p.
miR-21a-5p is essential for the renoprotective effects of MSC-Exos
To further explore whether miR-21a-5p is involved in MSC-Exo-mediated renoprotective effects in vivo, mice were administered miR-21a-5p inhibitor -Exos or miR-21a-5p mimic -Exos. Compared to the NC-Exo group, mice treated with miR-21a-5p inhibitor -Exos showed renewed atrophy of TECs, loss of brush borders and dilation of the tubular lumen, while MSC-Exo-overexpressing miR-21a-5p significantly attenuated these pathological changes (Fig.  6A ). Sirius red and immunohistochemistry staining revealed that knockdown of miR-21a-5p significantly increased the deposition of collagenous fibers and ECM, which was significantly counteracted by miR-21a-5p mimic -Exos (Fig.  6B, C ). Immunofluorescence staining indicated that miR-21a-5p inhibitor -Exos reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-21a-5p mimic -Exos on α-SMA expression (Fig.  6D ). Furthermore, knockdown of miR-21a-5p significantly enhanced the expression of HK2 in TECs compared to that in TECs treated with miR-21a-5p mimic (Fig.  6E ). Similarly, downregulation of miR-21a-5p significantly upregulated the levels of ECM proteins and glycolysis-related enzymes (Fig.  6F  and S 5G ). In addition, miR-21a-5p inhibitor -Exos reversed the decrease in lactate concentration induced by NC-Exos and miR-21a-5p mimic -Exos (Fig.  6G ). These results suggested that miR-21a-5p is essential for the renoprotective and antiglycolytic effects of MSC-Exos.
