IFN-γ and TWEAK influence RASF proliferation
Since we found TNF/IFN-γ to upregulate Fn14, BCMA, TACI, BAFF-R, IFN-γR and ObR, we next investigated how ligation of these receptors with TWEAK (Fn14), BAFF (BAFF-R = TACI»BCMA), APRIL (BCMA = TACI), IFN-γ (IFN-γR) and leptin (ObR) influences RASF proliferation and the cytokine-induced production of IL-6 and IL-8. Proliferation of RASF was significantly increased by the addition of TNF ([c] 1 ng/ml, 128% ± 7.1; p < 0.001; [c] 10 ng/ml, 138% ± 11; p < 0.001) and further enhanced by the addition of IFN-γ as compared to TNF 10 ng/ml alone ([c] 0.1 ng/ml, 161% ± 17; p < 0.001; [c] 1 ng/ml, 172% ± 17; p < 0.001; [c] 10 ng/ml, 178% ± 16; p < 0.001; Fig.  3A ). TWEAK and APRIL exerted a positive effect on TNF-induced proliferation (p = 0.001 and p = 0.019, respectively; Fig.  3B,C ) while BAFF and leptin had no influence on proliferation (Fig.  3D,E ).

IFN-γ and TWEAK influence RASF cytokine production
Next, IL-6 and IL-8 production of RASF were investigated under the influence of TNF and IFN-γ together with TWEAK, APRIL, BAFF and leptin. As expected, TNF dose-dependently increased IL-6 ([c] 1 ng/ml, 1334% ± 739%; p = 0.005, [c] 10 ng/ml, 3616% ± 2096%, p < 0.001; Fig.  4A ) and IL-8 ([c] 1 ng/ml, 11617% ± 4146%; p < 0.001; [c] 10 ng/ml 29906% ± 17668%, p < 0.001 for IL-8, Fig.  5A ) production. Addition of IFN γ antagonized TNF (10 ng/ml) –induced IL-6 ([c] 1 ng/ml, 19447% ± 1123%; p = 0.001; [c] 10 ng/ml, 1558% ± 755%, p < 0.001 Fig.  4A ) and IL-8 ([c] 0.1 ng/ml, 12342% ± 5999%; p < 0.001; [c] 1 ng/ml, 1289% ± 870%, p < 0.001; [c] 10 ng/ml, 816% ± 633%, p < 0.001, Fig.  5A ) production, respectively. TWEAK (p = 0.047, Fig.  4B ) but not BAFF (Fig.  4D ), APRIL (Fig.  4C ) or leptin (Fig.  4E ) reduced TNF-induced IL-6 production. The TNF-induced or TNF/IFN-γ-induced IL-8 production was not modulated by TWEAK, APRIL, BAFF or leptin (Fig.  5B–E ). Figure 4 A ) IL-6 production in response to TNF and TNF combined with IFN-γ.

TNF and IFN-γ stimulated RASF modulate B cell survival
Since cytokines of the TNF family are broadly involved in B cell homeostasis, we aimed to clarify whether RASF stimulated with TNF or IFN-γ differentially affect B cell survival. Since we used murine B cells (mBcells) on human fibroblasts for these experiments, we first showed that human BAFF has an impact on murine B cells and found that conditioned medium from RASF stimulated for 48 h with human BAFF (0.1 ng/ml–10 ng/ml) increased murine B cell survival in RASF/B cell co cultures (Fig.  6A ). Conditioned medium also increased survival in B cell monocultures (p = 0.009, B cells alone vs B cells in conditioned medium, Fig.  6A ). The pro-survival effect was mediated to a great extent by BAFF, since addition of the BAFF neutralizing antibody belimumab at 10 µg/ml decreased survival back to control values (p < 0.001, [c] IFN-γ 10 ng/ml, Fig.  6A ). Similar results were obtained in co-culture experiments in which murine B cells were co-cultivated with BAFF-stimulated RASF for 48 h (Fig.  6B ). BAFF (1 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml) increased murine B cell survival (p < 0.001) also in coculture with RASF and this effect was inhibited by addition of belimumab (p < 0.001). Since IFN-γ induces the production of BAFF in RASF, we speculated that IFN-γ pre-treated RASF increase mBcell survival by enhanced BAFF production. Indeed, belimumab inhibited the pro-survival effects of IFN-γ treated RASF on B cell survival (p < 0.001, Fig.  6C ). We then tested how RASF stimulated with TNF alone or in combination with IFN- γ affects murine B cell survival. Conditioned medium from RASF treated with TNF, IFN-γ or a combination did not enhance mBcell survival (Fig.  6D ). Conversely, in RASF/mBcell co-culture, TNF (p = 0.079) or IFN-γ (p = 0.006) alone increased mBcell survival, while a combination of both decreased B cell survival (p = 0.008 vs TNF alone and p = 0.001 vs IFN-γ alone, Fig.  6E ). These data suggest that expression of a specific, membrane-bound survival molecule is altered in response to TNF/IFN-γ in RASF. Since we found membrane-bound BAFF and CD40L, both factors that would augment B cell survival 13 , 21 , to increase with TNF/IFN-γ, these molecules are unlikely candidates for the decreased survival of B cells cultivated together with TNF/IFN-γ-stimulated RASF. We suspected a different protein on RASF to be responsible for decreased B cell survival. One important survival factor for B cells is VCAM-1 22  and therefore, we investigated how this adhesion molecule is regulated under our culture conditions. We found that TNF (+332% ± 216%, p < 0.001) and TNF/IFN-γ (+214% ± 77%, p = 0.01) induce significant cell surface expression of VCAM-1 (Fig.  6F ). Since VCAM-1 is shedded from the cell surface by the enzyme ADAM17 23 , we also determined soluble VCAM-1 levels. We found that only TNF/IFN-γ strongly induced soluble VCAM-1 (1464 pg/ml ± 675 pg/ml vs 90 pg/ml ± 77 pg/ml (control); + 2286% ± 1421%, p < 0.001, Fig.  6H ). While differential VCAM-1 levels on RASF might alter B cell survival, RASF also produce transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a cytokine reported to influence B cell maturation, homeostasis, activation and most importantly, to promote apoptosis 24 – 27 . Consequently, we also assessed cell surface levels of this cytokine and found that TNF (+141% ± 37%, p < 0.001) and, even more pronounced, TNF/IFN-γ (+193% ± 30%, p < 0.001) up-regulated membrane-bound TGF-β (Fig.  6G ). TNF/IFN-γ induced significantly higher levels of membrane-bound TGF-β as compared to TNF or IFN-γ alone (p < 0.001, Fig.  6G ). Figure 6 A , D ) B cell survival in conditioned medium. B cells were transferred in conditioned medium generated from RASF cultured for 48 h with or without BAFF, belimumab, TNF or IFN-γ. ( B , C , E ) B cell/RASF co-culture.

We determined the cell surface levels of BAFF, TACI, BCMA, BAFF-R, CD40L, Fn14, INF-γR and ObR under the influence of TNF (10 ng/ml), and IFN-γ (10 ng/ml). Whereas INF-γ alone had no significant effect on the proteins investigated, we found the combination of IFN-γ and TNF to be a strong stimulus that robustly increased membrane (m)BAFF (185% ± 80%; p < 0.001; Fig.  1A ), CD40L (174% ± 51%; p < 0.001; Fig.  1B ), IFN-γR (190% ± 54%; p < 0.001; Fig.  1C ), ObR (200% ± 68%; p < 0.001; Fig.  1D ), Fn14 (246% ± 71%; p < 0.001; Fig.  1E ), TACI (190% ± 108%; p = 0.001; Fig.  1F ), BAFF-R (264% ± 246%; p = 0.001; Fig.  1G ) and BCMA (202% ± 115%; p = 0.009; Fig.  1H ) in RASF. However, TNF alone increased the surface levels of Fn14 (151% ± 63%; p = 0.032; Fig.  1E ) and per statistical trend IFN-γR (147% ± 70%; p = 0.057; Fig.  1C ).

All FACS measurements were normalized to the geometric mean of the unstimulated control value, which was set at 100% (dotted line). P-values are given in the graph. The general linear model with Bonferroni correction was used for all comparisons versus control. Cell surface levels of membrane-bound BAFF (
IFN-γ induces soluble BAFF, which in turn is inhibited by TNF. With the exception of IFN-γR, all TNF family member proteins investigated in this study are also shedded from the cell surface 19 , 20 , and therefore we assessed the amount of soluble BAFF, APRIL, CD40L, BCMA and TACI. In RASF stimulated with TNF, IFN-γ, or a combination of both cytokines for 72 h, no soluble APRIL, CD40L, BCMA and TACI was detected (data not shown). In contrast, BAFF production was dose-dependently induced by IFN-γ (Fig.  2A ) and inhibited by addition of TNF (p = 0.002; Fig.  2B ). Figure 2 A ) IFN-γ induced BAFF production by RASF.
