In this study we demonstrated synergistic effects of IFN-γ and TNF on the expression of TNF family member receptors, associated cytokine receptors and RASF proliferation. In contrast, cytokine production was negatively regulated by the combination of TNF and IFN-γ: While BAFF production was inhibited by TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 production was reduced by IFN-γ. Similarly, survival was increased by TNF or IFN-γ-stimulated RASF but reduced by the combination of both cytokines. These findings along with the shedding of VCAM-1 and the up-regulation of TGF-β by the combination of IFN-γ and TNF confirm a partial anti-inflammatory effect of IFN-γ in a TNF-driven pro-inflammatory environment in RA. In fact, it has already been shown that IFN-γR knockout mice show exacerbated arthritis 11 . Interestingly, in lupus erythematodes (SLE), IFN-γ is a prerequisite for disease development and this might be due to the cell type mainly responsible for disease initiation 59 . While lupus is mainly driven by the activity of autoreactive B cells, RA is dependent on T cell activation and innate mechanisms 60 , 61 . This is also evident in the therapeutic approach of both diseases, where RA profits from TNF inhibition, while SLE is combatted by B cell-depleting agents, like belimumab, whereas anti-TNF treatment exacerbates or even induces SLE. IFN-γ also induced soluble VCAM-1 when combined with TNF, which might, similar to soluble ICAM-1 alter leucocyte recruitment dependent on cell type and inhibit B cell attachment by disrupting VCAM1/integrin α4β1 interactions 62 , 63 . Additionally, increased membrane-bound TGF-β under the same culture conditions might not only alter B cell but also T cell function und support T-reg generation leading to an overall anti-inflammatory phenotype 64 .
