SIRs for Second Female Genital Cancers Among Breast Cancer Survivors
Table  1  shows the SIRs for second primary cervical cancer and second primary corpus uteri cancer among breast cancer survivors. There were 295 cervical cancers and 3033 endometrial cancers after first primary breast cancer (Supplementary Table  1 ). The SIR for cervical cancer was decreased with statistical significance for patients with first breast cancer, while the SIR for corpus uteri cancer increased for patients with first breast cancer (SIR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.57–0.72; SIR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13–1.21, respectively). Decreased SIRs for cervical cancer patients were observed for all years of breast cancer diagnosis, all ages at breast cancer diagnosis, all latency periods, and all menopausal statuses after breast cancer diagnosis. The SIRs for the ER+ and ER−PR− subtypes were both decreased in patients with cervical cancer. In addition, the increased SIRs for corpus uteri cancer patients were observed in all years of breast cancer diagnosis but declined for more recent time periods (2000–2004 SIR, 1.37; 2005–2009 SIR, 1.26; 2010–2014 SIR, 1.08). The SIRs for all latency periods except the first 6–11 months after breast cancer diagnosis were elevated and increased with the time period (12–59 SIR, 1.13; 60–119 SIR, 1.22; 120+ SIR, 1.27). The SIRs for ER+PR+ and ER− breast cancer were all elevated in patients with corpus uteri cancer.

Table  2  shows the SIRs for patients with second primary ovarian cancer after first breast cancer (SIR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06–1.18). A total of 1412-s primary ovarian cancers were examined and analyzed in our study. The elevated SIRs were observed in groups containing patients under 60 years of age, and the SIRs decreased with increasing age at breast cancer diagnosis (age under 40 SIR, 6.00; 40–49 SIR, 2.43; 50–59 SIR, 1.46). In the 70+ age group, patients with first breast cancer had a decreased risk of developing second ovarian cancer compared to the general group (SIR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.96). Elevated SIRs were also observed in the 12–119-month latency periods (12–59 SIR, 1.10; 60–119 SIR, 1.16). Additionally, SIRs for second primary ovarian cancer were significantly increased after ER− breast cancer (ER−PR+ SIR, 2.18; ER−PR− SIR,1.81). In contrast, for the ER+PR+ subtype of breast cancer, there was a decreased risk of developing second ovarian cancer (SIR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–0.99). Meanwhile, premenopausal patients showed higher SIRs than those with other menopausal statuses.

Risk Factors of Developing a Second Female Genital Cancer After Breast Cancer
The clinical characteristics of the women who developed breast cancer only and those who developed second primary female genital cancer are shown in the  supplementary Tables . Women with breast cancer only differed from those who developed second primary corpus uteri cancer in terms of the year of breast cancer diagnosis, age at breast cancer diagnosis, race, and ER and PR status, based on significant differences in chi-square tests (Supplementary Table  1 ). Women with breast cancer only also differed significantly from those who developed second primary ovarian cancer in terms of the year of breast cancer diagnosis, race, and ER and PR status (Supplementary Table  2 ). With regard to age at breast cancer diagnosis, we found no statistically significant differences between women with breast cancer only and women with second primary ovarian cancer.
When we considered risk factors for second primary corpus uteri cancer after breast cancer (Table  3 ), the risk of second primary corpus uteri cancer was positively associated with the age at first cancer (46–55 vs. ≤ 45 years, aHR = 2.343,  P  < 0.001; 56+ vs. ≤ 45 years, aHR = 3.218,  P  < 0.001) (Fig.  1 a), race (black vs. white, aHR = 1.142,  P  = 0.042), and PR status (positive vs. negative, aHR = 1.131,  P  = 0.043) (Fig.  1 b), while an inverse association was found with the year of first cancer, and ER status showed no association with risk ( P  = 0.293). Our study also demonstrated that the risk of second primary ovarian cancer was positively associated with the year of first cancer and age at first cancer (56+ years vs. ≤ 45 years, aHR = 1.453,  P  < 0.001) (Fig.  1 c), while an inverse association was found with race (black vs. white, aHR = 0.691,  P  = 0.001) and ER status (positive vs. negative, aHR = 0.655,  P  < 0.001) (Fig.  1 d), and PR status showed no association with risk ( P  = 0.060).
