In this study, MSN-TanIIA-PEG with favorable dispersity and biological characteristics was successfully prepared. The antitumor efficacies of nano-TanIIA on HCC  in vitro  were greatly improved, which outperformed free-TanIIA in terms of proliferation and invasion inhibition, and apoptosis induction of HCC cells. Capable of releasing TanIIA into carcinoma cells in a sustained manner, this formulation may be an appropriate candidate for pharmacological application. Nonetheless, the specific mechanism still needs to be further explored, and its efficacy and safety deserve more  in vivo  investigations before clinical trials. Additionally, GPC3-shRNA plasmids were successfully constructed, and MSN-PEG showed an excellent gene transfection efficiency and may thus serve as a carrier for gene therapy. The findings of this study also offer a novel idea for HCC treatment, where MSN-PEG is used as a carrier to combine TanIIA together with GPC3-shRNA.
