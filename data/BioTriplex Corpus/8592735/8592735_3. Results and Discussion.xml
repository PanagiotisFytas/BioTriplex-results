3.1. Characterization of Nanoparticles

           3.1.1. Particle Size, Zeta Potential, and Morphological Features 
           26 ]. In this study, TanIIA-loaded MSN-PEG nanoparticles were prepared, as described previously. The DL and EE of MSN-TanIIA-PEG nanoparticles were 9.32% and 93.13%, respectively. It was reported that nanocarriers have high drug loading capacity, excellent tolerability, high stability, and low drug degradation, which achieve controlled release and sustained delivery of antineoplastics [ 
           2(a) – 2(h)  display the size distribution of the particles, as well as the zeta potential of the MSN, MSN-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA-PEG, and MSN-PEG. As suggested by the results of DLS assessment, MSN has a hydrodynamic size of 78 nm and a zeta potential of −36.0 mV. With the gradual modification of the MSN nanoparticles with TanIIA and PEI-PEG, the MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG exhibited increases in the hydrodynamic size separately to 90 nm and 117 nm. Besides, the surface charges of MSN and MSN-TanIIA were −36 mV and −30 mV, indicating negative charges. Interestingly, both MSN-TanIIA-PEG and MSN-PEG had positive charges with values of 43.2 mV and 47 mV, respectively. This verified the negative-to-positive changes in the surface charges of nanoparticles. The foregoing results imply the successful modification of nanoparticles. Moreover, the positive charges enabled formation of an electrostatic complex by the carrier with shRNA, thereby protecting it from nucleases and facilitating its cellular uptake [ 27 ]. Figures  
           2(i) – 2(l) , the majority of the nanoparticles, regardless of modified or not, was about 50 nm in particle size, which had a regular spherical shape, uniform particle size, and good monodispersity. The surface-modified particles maintained the basic morphology. Additionally, it was obviously observed that the surface mesoporous pores became blurred, and there was a white halo on the nanoparticle periphery, which corresponded to the surface modification with the polymer layer. It has been reported that nanoparticles with a size of 100–200 nm can be quickly eliminated from the blood by macrophages in the RES after entering the circulation. In contrast, the nanoparticles 50–100 nm in size are capable of entering liver cells and target drugs to the liver [ 2 ]. According to the EPR effect, nanoparticles with particle size less than 100 nm can easily pass through the interstices of the tumor tissue and thus remain in the tumor tissue [ 28 ]. In the present study, the prepared nanoparticle size was about 50 nm, which is in accordance with the preparation requirements of particle size between 50 nm and 100 nm. TEM analysis was performed to elucidate the morphology of the nanoparticles. According to the TEM micrographs in Figures  
        

           In Vitro  Drug Release 3.1.2.  
           29 ,  30 ]. For effectiveness validation of the nanoparticles in drug delivery, the  in vitro  release of TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG was employed at various time intervals (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h), and the curve of TanIIA release was plotted ( Figure 2(m) ). According to the  in vitro  TanIIA release curve, both MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG showed a typical pattern of two-phase release. The TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG was initially released at a rapid rate with 71.89% and 59.7% in the first 6 h, which was denoted as incubation period. From 7 to 24 h, the sustained release phase, the cumulative release of the drug gradually increased. After 12 h, the release gradually decreased, which was followed by the smooth release until 24 h. The sustained release reached 97.27% and 97.95% at 24 h for MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG, respectively. It was obviously seen that the percentage of TanIIA release in MSN-TanIIA was higher than that of MSN-TanIIA-PEG. The high burst release of MSN-TanIIA may prevent drugs from reaching to the target tissues or cells, thus making it less effective. On the contrary, the sustained release of MSN-TanIIA-PEG was more suitable for the drug release properties of nanoparticles [ 31 ]. Some studies have demonstrated that the entrapped drug release from the nanoparticles in a sustained manner extended the plasma biological half-life for the natural compounds [ 
        
3.2.  In Vitro  Antitumor Activity

           3.2.1. Cell Proliferation Inhibition Assay 
           μ g/mL) using the CCK-8 kit. The results revealed increases in the growth inhibition rates of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The IC 50  of free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG were 14.842  μ g/mL, 9.298  μ g/mL, and 6.959  μ g/mL, respectively ( Figure 3(a) ), while the blank nanoparticles (MSN-PEG) and DMSO had no significant effects on the cells' growth. Suggestively, the slower and sustained TanIIA release from the MSN-TanIIA-PEG led to reduced effective dose (IC 50 ) and obtained superior therapeutic efficacy  in vitro  to the free-TanIIA for HCC cells. Similar observations have also been reported by Yang et al. [ 12 ] and Sun et al. [ 21 ], where IC 50  of many nanoparticles of natural products was lower than that of the free products. The cell growth inhibition effect was examined under various concentrations of free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG (0–80  
        

           3.2.2. Cell Apoptosis Assays 
           32 ]. The apoptotic cell nuclei exhibit a high intensity of fluorescence, while weak fluorescence is noted in the nonapoptotic cells [ 33 ]. To evaluate the apoptosis of HepG2 cells induced by MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG, the cellular nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33342 followed by fluorescence microscope evaluation. Compared with the intact control nuclei, the cells intervened with MSN-PEG showed little difference, while the cells intervened with free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG all exhibited nucleus shrinkage and were stained bright blue or showed debris-like lobulation of nuclei ( Figure 3(b) ). However, within similar sized fields, there were more apoptotic cells in the MSN-TanIIA-PEG group than in the free-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA groups. This observation is consistent with a previous finding that noisome-coated TanIIA could enhance the apoptosis of HepG2 cells [ 2 ]. Hoechst 33342 is typically used for detecting cell apoptosis, and the principle is that it can permeate apoptotic cellular membranes freely, and that apoptotic cells can be identified by the bright blue-stained nuclei that are either condensed or scattered [ 
           Figure 3(c) , the control cells exhibited an exceptionally low apoptosis rate, which was only 8.26 ± 2.83%. In contrast, the cell apoptosis induced by MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG amounted to 12.81 ± 3.40%, 18.92 ± 3.55%, 30.63 ± 4.09%, and 38.68 ± 6.57%, respectively. Obviously, the cell apoptosis induced by MSN-TanIIA-PEG was far stronger than that induced by other methods ( P  < 0.05). The finding was consistent with the result of Hoechst 33342 staining assay. Moreover, the apoptotic results coincided with the cell proliferation inhibition data as well. Subsequently, HepG2 cells intervened with MSN and TanIIA were doubly stained with Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647 plus PI, and then the cell apoptosis induced by intervention was determined by flow cytometry. As shown in  
        

           3.2.3. Cell Cycle Assay 
           Figure 3(d) , the MSN-TanIIA-PEG intervention group showed an increased  G 0/ G 1 phase cell population compared with the control group, which was also more significant than the MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA intervention groups. This finding suggested that nano-TanIIA intervention could affect the arrest of cell cycle at  G 0/ G 1, the phases of DNA replication [ 34 ]. In other words, MSN-TanIIA-PEG prevented the duplication of DNA, diminished the S phase cell proportion during DNA synthesis, and inhibited the G2/M phase accumulation of cells. As a result, HepG2 cells' growth and proliferation were effectively suppressed. Following the verification of cell apoptosis effect induced by MSN-TanIIA-PEG, flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the variation trends of HepG2 cell distribution by the MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG over the cell cycle phases. According to  
           G 0/ G 1 checkpoint in a dose-related manner [ 35 ,  36 ]. It also agreed with the finding of another study demonstrating a differing effect of the drug-entrapped nanoparticles on the distribution of cell cycle from the free-form drug [ 37 ]. However, the effect of TanIIA on the cell cycle distribution remains controversial. Some studies observed that TanIIA could arrest cells at the  S / G 2 phases [ 37 ,  38 ]. After HepG2 cells were intervened with MSN-TanIIA-PEG, the  G 0/ G 1 phase cell distribution increased, while the proportion of S and G2/M phase cells decreased, which remains to be further explored. This finding is consistent with the previous research showing the ability of TanIIA to arrest cells at the  
        

           3.2.4. Cell Invasion Ability Assay 
           Figure 3(e) ). Compared with the free-TanIIA group, the cell invasion inhibition rate in nano-TanIIA groups (MSN-TanIIA: 59.66 ± 5.09% and MSN-TanIIA-PEG: 71.61 ± 2.58%) was significantly increased. As shown in  Figure 3(e) , HepG2 cells intervened with MSN-TanIIA-PEG exhibited higher cell invasion inhibition rates than other counterparts. These results indicated that MSN-TanIIA-PEG has the strongest cell invasion inhibition effect on HepG2 cells. To explore the role of TanIIA in the HCC development, the transwell experiment was employed to examine how TanIIA affected the HepG2 cell invasiveness. Similar to the above outcomes, TanIIA showed remarkable suppression of cell invasion. The cell invasion inhibition rate of the free-TanIIA group was 35.95 ± 8.98%, which was higher than MSN-PEG group's 20.17 ± 8.54% ( 
           Taken together, our findings suggested that MSN-TanIIA-PEG could suppress HCC cell growth and invasion and promote apoptosis, which may exert a crucial effect on the HCC progression. However, the specific mechanism still needs further verification by molecular biology experiments. 
        
3.3. Identification of GPC3-shRNA Plasmid
The presence of correct clones was identified by sequencing comparison, which implied that the GPC3-shRNA plasmids were constructed successfully ( Figure 4(a) ).
3.4. Binding, Release, and Digestion of MSN-PEG with GPC3-shRNA Plasmids
Gene therapy targeting GPC3 holds a tremendous potential for HCC treatment, especially the RNAi therapy. The primary difficulty in its clinical application is still the safe and efficient design of delivery carriers. Inspiringly, PEG, a neutral and hydrophilic polymer, has been used widely, which helped lower the cytotoxicity and extend the circulation time. Moreover, there has also been a broad application of positively charged PEI owing to its high DNA condensing and transfection efficiencies [ 20 ,  39 ]. The ability of plasmid binding onto MSN-PEG and the capacities of DNA digestion protection and release were identified by gel retardation assays. As seen from electrophoresis image, when plasmids were added at mass ratios (GPC3-shRNA to MSN-PEG) of 1 : 0, 1 : 5, and 1 : 10, a clear band was observable in the corresponding lane. When the mass ratio was 1 : 20, no band could be observed ( Figure 4(b) ), indicating that GPC3-shRNA plasmids could be completely loaded onto the nanoparticles, so that the optimal binding ratio was 1 : 20.
Electrophoresis of release assay revealed that no DNA band was observed at 1, 4, 8, 12, or 24 h. Nevertheless, the brightness of the electrophoretic band increased within 48 and 72 h, and there was no significant difference between the 3rd and the 4th day, indicating that MSN-PEG was capable of protecting the pDNA from degradation and reasonably releasing pDNA under appropriate conditions ( Figure 4(c) ).
In order to observe the stability of the nanoparticle/pDNA complex, the DNase-I digestion experiment was performed. After the complex of MSN-PEG/GPC3-shRNA was added with DNase-I enzyme, the brightness of the electrophoretic band remained stable in the first 1 h. On the contrary, after digestion with DNase-I enzyme, the naked pDNA was almost completely digested within 1 min, and no bands could be seen on the electrophoresis lane, verifying that nanoparticles could effectively protect the pDNA from nuclease digestion ( Figure 4(d) ).
3.5. Evaluation of MSN-PEG Gene Transfection Efficiency
Using MSN-PEG as a carrier, the GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were transfected into HepG2 cells for the transfection efficiency observation of GPC3-shRNA plasmids under a fluorescence microscope. As the EGFP expression indicated, no obvious difference was observed in transfection efficiency between MSN-PEG and Lipo2000 in the HepG2 cells ( Figure 5(a) ). Besides, the transfection efficiency of MSN-PEG was 34.37 ± 1.06% as analyzed by flow cytometry, with no significant difference from the liposome group's 31.78 ± 1.30% ( Figure 5(b) ). As suggested by the foregoing findings, MSN-PEG has an encouraging potential as a gene-transferring carrier in gene therapy.
HepG2 cells were transfected with GPC3-shRNA via MSN-PEG for 24 h, and then GPC3 gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR combined with Western blotting. It was found that GPC3 mRNA expression in the untransfected (control) group differed indistinctly from that in the negative control (NC) group, although they were both higher than that in the GPC3-shRNA plasmid-transfected group ( Figure 5(c) ). Correspondingly, the expression level of GPC3 protein was reduced after GPC3-shRNA plasmid transfection, as shown in  Figure 5(d) . This further confirms the successful establishment of GPC3-shRNA plasmids and the workability of using MSN-PEG to transfer target gene in gene therapy. In a word, it offered a new idea of using MSN-PEG as a vector to carry TanIIA and GPC3-shRNA for comprehensive treatment of HCC in clinics.
