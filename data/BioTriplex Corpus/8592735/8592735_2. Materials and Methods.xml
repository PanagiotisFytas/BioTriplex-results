Monodisperse mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were provided by Nanoeast Biotech (Nanjing, China), which are a kind of inorganic nanomaterials with a highly ordered mesoporous structure, good chemical and thermal stability, and a large number of easily modified hydroxyl functional groups on the surface. PEG5k-PEI25k was provided by Tanshui Biotech (Shenzhen, China). The Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647/PI Apoptosis Assay kit was purchased from FcMACS (Nanjing, China). Lipofectamine 2000, Tango Buffer, and DNase-I enzyme were purchased from Solarbio (Beijing, China). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was obtained from Beyotime Biotech (Shanghai, China). Fluorescent Hoechst 33342, crystal violet, and the rest of the reagents were purchased from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China).
The human HepG2 hepatocellular cancer cell line was obtained from the Shanghai Institute of Cell Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). HepG2 cells were inoculated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (GIBCO, US) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, US) and supplemented with streptomycin and penicillin (GIBCO, US). The cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2.
2.2. Preparation of the Nanoparticles
The MSN-TanIIA-PEG was prepared according to a film dispersion-ultrasonic method in the published articles [ 9 ,  21 ]. The first step was preparation of TanIIA-loaded MSNs. 5 mg MSN (25 mg/mL) and 500  μ g TanIIA (10 mg/mL) were mixed evenly in ethanol, and then 100  μ L of water was added slowly into the above solution under ultrasonic condition followed by 2-h incubation in a 37°C shaker. Finally, centrifugation was carried out at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to remove the residual solvent, so as to obtain the required sample (denoted as MSN-TanIIA), which was dried in a 45°C vacuum for 12 h and then stored at 4°C.
The next step was coating of the prepared MSN-TanIIA with PEI-PEG. In a nutshell, 5 mg MSN-TanIIA (10 mg/mL) was dripped into 20 mg (50 mg/mL) PEI-PEG followed by probe sonication for 20 min. After removing extra PEI-PEG and free-TanIIA in the solution via 10-min centrifugation (10,000 rpm), the remaining was washed three times in 2 mL of saline via 5-min centrifugation (10,000 rpm) to get TanIIA-loaded PEI-PEG-coated MSNs, denoted as MSN-TanIIA-PEG. Meanwhile, MSN-PEG was also prepared by the same method.
The entrapped TanIIA in the obtained sample solution was quantified by HPLC. The drug loading capacity (DL, %) and encapsulation efficiency (EE, %) were calculated by the following equations: (1) DL  % = amount of TanIIA encapsulated in NPs  total amount of NPs × 100 , EE  % = amount of TanIIA loaded in NPs initial TanIIA added × 100.
2.3. HPLC Method for Determining TanIIA

           2.3.1. Instruments and Conditions 
           22 ], the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (LC-15C; Shimadzu, Japan) with a WondaSil C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5  μ m) was used for determination of TanIIA in MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG. In addition, the mobile phase of the HPLC system consisted of 70% acetonitrile (A) and 30% ultrapure water (B) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, column temperature was kept at 30°C, and the detection wavelength was 268 nm. Taking the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition) and Liu et al.'s research as reference [ 
        

           2.3.2. Standard Solution and Sample Preparation 
           μ g/mL. Acetonitrile was used to break down the internal structure of the samples, thereby extracting the TanIIA before detecting [ 23 ,  24 ]. TanIIA standard solutions (1 mg/mL) were prepared in acetonitrile and stored at −20°C until use. Mobile phase was used to dilute standard solutions to the concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100  
        
2.4. Characterization of the Nanoparticles
The physical and chemical properties of MSN-TanIIA-PEG were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta potential, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The particle size (nm) and zeta potential (mV) of nanoparticles were evaluated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) at 25°C using the Zeta Plus Zetasizer (Brookhaven Instruments, USA). All the samples were dispersed in deionized water and sonicated before the analysis. The morphology of the uncoated and coated nanoparticles was observed by a JEM-2100 TEM instrument (JEOL, Japan).
2.5.  In Vitro  Drug Release
A dialysis technique was employed for the release profile investigation of TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG. Initially, 1 mL of the sample solution (1 mg/mL) was added to a dialysis bag (MW:3500), which was soaked in 5 mL of PBS buffer (0.02 M, pH = 7.4, containing 0.2% Tween-80), followed by stirring in a shaking bed at 100 rpm and 37°C away from light. At the preset points of time, each 1.0 mL of sample was removed from the release medium, and then the system was replenished with an equal volume of PBS. The HPLC was finally employed to examine how much TanIIA was released into the release solution.
2.6.  In Vitro  Antitumor Activity
To investigate the antitumor activity of MSN-TanIIA-PEG,  in vitro  proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion were assessed (see Sections  2.6.1 / 2.6.2 / 2.6.3 / 2.6.4 ).

           2.6.1. CCK-8 Assay 
           4  cells were seeded into 96-well plates overnight. Then, the cells were intervened with a series of different concentrations (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80  μ g/mL) of free-TanIIA, TanIIA-MSN, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG for 24 h. DMSO was used as a solvent for TanIIA, and thus the HepG2 cells in DMEM containing 0.3% DMSO were used as the untreated control group (0  μ g/mL). Moreover, MSN-PEG was also used as a blank nanoparticle control. Subsequently, 10  µ L of CCK-8 reagent was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C according to the manufacturer's protocol. Finally, the absorbance was measured using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, USA) at a wavelength of 450 nm. The cell growth inhibition rate of the HepG2 cells was calculated according to the formula: cell growth inhibition rate (%) = (1 − experimental absorbance value/control absorbance value) × 100. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) were determined using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (La Jolla, USA). A CCK-8 assay was conducted to determine the cell proliferation inhibitory effect of the three different TanIIA formulations (free-TanIIA, TanIIA-MSN, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG) on HepG2 cells. In brief, the 3 × 10 
        

           2.6.2. Hoechst 33342 Staining Assay 
           5  cells) were intervened with free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG at an equivalent TanIIA concentration of 10  μ g/mL. Besides, the concentration of MSN-PEG in the MSN-PEG group was 100  μ g/mL. After additional 24-h incubation at 37°C, the cells were washed with cold PBS. Hoechst 33342 (1  μ g/mL) was added to each well. After being incubated at 37°C for 15 min, the cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany). After seeding into 24-well plates overnight, HepG2 cells (1 × 10 
        

           2.6.3. Flow Cytometry Analysis 
           5  cells per well in 6-well plates overnight. Afterward, the cells were intervened with MSN-PEG (100  μ g/mL), free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG (at an equivalent TanIIA concentration of 10  μ g/mL) for 24 h. Before the intervention, the cells were inoculated at 4 × 10 
           μ L) and PI (10  μ L, 20  μ g/mL) at room temperature protected from light for 15 min and a subsequent resuspension in 500  μ L of binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 ). The stained cells were detected immediately using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, USA). For apoptosis detection, the cells were collected and PBS-washed followed by staining with Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647 (5  
           μ L; 20  μ g/mL PI and 5  μ g/mL RNase A in PBS) in the dark for 30 min at ambient temperature followed by FACSCalibur analysis. For the cell cycle assessment, the cells were harvested, PBS-washed, and fixed overnight at 4°C in cold 70% ethanol. After collecting and washing with PBS, the cells were stained using propidium iodide (PI) solution (100  
        

           2.6.4. Transwell Assay 
           5  cells) were seeded in a 6-well plate and pretreated with MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG. Cell invasion ability was measured using the transwell assay. In detail, HepG2 cells (4 × 10 
           5  cells (200  μ L) were transferred into the upper transwell chambers (8  μ m; BD Biosciences, USA). The inferior chamber was filled with 500  μ L of 10% FBS-containing DMEM. Following 24-h incubation at 37°C, the cells were subjected to twice PBS washing, 30-min fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, and 20-min staining with crystal violet (0.1%) at room temperature. Then, the cells were washed with water 3 times. After this, a cotton swab was used to remove the nontraveled cells from the upper filter surface in a gentle manner. Finally, the cell pictures were obtained under a microscope and the cell numbers were quantified with ImageJ software. The cell invasion inhibition rate was calculated following this formula: The cell invasion inhibition rate (%) = (cells' count of untreated group − cells' count of the treatment group)/cells' count of untreated group × 100. Initially, 50 mg/L Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) was coated onto the transwell insert membrane at a 1 : 8 dilution at the apical side. After collection from every group, the cells were resuspended in a serum-free medium, and then 1 × 10 
        
2.7. Construction and Identification of the GPC3-shRNA Plasmid
The GPC3-shRNA plasmid was constructed as our previous description [ 25 ]. The plasmid was purchased from Manfute biotech (Nanjing, China). Human GPC3 sequences (GenBank ID: 2719) were selected as the target site for RNAi. For pSLenti-GPC3-shRNA plasmid construction, driven by the U6 promoter, the annealed oligonucleotides (double-stranded) were inserted into pSLenti plasmids by T4 DNA ligation using AegI-EcoRI restriction sites. The primer sequence (designed by Primer3 software) upstream was 5′-CCGGCCGAAGAAGGGAACTAATTCTCAAGAGAAATTAGTTCCCTTCTTCGGTTTTTTG-3′, and the downstream was 5′-AATTCAAAAAACCGAAGAAGGGAACTAATTTCTCTTGAGAATTAGTTCCCTTCTTCGG-3′. After shaking the bacterial solution, the positive clones were identified by PCR, the reaction conditions of GPC3-shRNA were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 60 s, followed by the final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Finally, sequence verification of the resulting pSLenti-U6-GPC3-shRNA plasmids was accomplished via DNA sequencing. Then, the vector NTI software was used to compare and analyze the sequencing results. Meanwhile, to examine the transfection efficiency, GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were constructed as well.
2.8. DNA Binding, Digestion Protection, and Release Experiments
For DNA binding, digestion protection, and release experiments, the methods reported in our previous work were used and the methods description partly reproduced our earlier wording [ 25 ].

           2.8.1. MSN-PEG Binding with GPC3-shRNA Experiment 
           μ L). After 60 min of incubation at room temperature, 5  μ L of each MSN/shRNA complex was subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) using 0.5  μ g/mL ethidium bromide (EB), with 40-min running of the gels at 110 V with Tris-acetate (TAE) buffer. Retardation of the motion of shRNA was observed with a UV lamp by using a G:BOX Chemi XX9 imaging system (Syngene, UK). To obtain the proper mass ratio of GPC3-shRNA plasmids to MSN-PEG, the same amount of shRNA was incubated with different concentrations of MSN-PEG solutions. GPC3-shRNA plasmids and MSN-PEG were mixed at the mass ratios of 1 : 0 (naked shRNA), 1 : 5, 1 : 10, 1 : 20, 1 : 40, 1 : 60, 1 : 80, and 1 : 100 (final plasmid concentration: 20 ng/ 
        

           2.8.2. DNA Digestion Protection Capacity 
           μ L ultrapure water. The naked shRNA plasmid DNA (pDNA) was treated the same way and served as a control. Finally, 5  μ L of each product was electrophoresed. GPC3-shRNA plasmids and MSN-PEG were mixed to form a complex according to a mass ratio of 1 : 20. The complex was then digested with DNase-I enzyme and Tango Buffer at 37°C for 1, 10, 30, 45, and 60 min. Later, the reaction was terminated by adding EDTA solution (100 mmol/L). This was followed by washing, drying of resultants, and a subsequent dissolution in 200

           μ g) and MSN-PEG were mixed to form a complex according to a mass ratio of 1 : 20. The complex was made to a 500  μ L volume by mixing with TE solution. For AGE detection, 5  μ L of sample was taken separately at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. GPC3-shRNA plasmids (10  
        
2.9. MSN-PEG Transfection Efficiency Detection
MSN-PEG and GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were individually dispersed in the DMEM culture medium. MSN-PEG and GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were incubated at a mass ratio of 20 : 1 for 30 min to make them mix sufficiently.
After HepG2 cells were cultured overnight, the medium was replaced with the above mixture. The culture medium was replaced by fresh DMEM after 5-h incubation. Additional 24-h incubation sustained before harvesting cells. Meanwhile, Lipofectamine 2000 transfection method, which conducted according to the instruction, served as comparison. The two methods' transfection efficiencies were observed using a fluorescence microscope and analyzed via FACSCalibur.
2.10. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Analysis
Using MSN-PEG as a carrier, the GPC3-shRNA plasmids and negative control were transfected into the HepG2 cells, and 24 h later, cellular mRNA detection of GPC3 was carried out by qRT-PCR. TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) was used to extract the cellular total RNA as per the instructions of the manufacturer. One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using ReverTra Ace™ qPCR RT Master Mix (TOYOBO Biotech, Japan). The reaction solution was subjected to 15-min incubation at 37°C and a subsequent 5-min heating to 98°C as per the instructions of the manufacturer. The final step was qRT-PCR analysis on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR instrument (Thermo Fisher, USA). The comparative Ct (2 −ΔΔCt ) method was used to calculate the relative fold changes of mRNA expression in different groups. The primer sequences are as follows: GPC3 (Beyotime, China): 5′-CCTTTGAAATTGTTCGCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGGGTTCATTAGCTGGGTA-3′ (reverse); GAPDH (Beyotime, China): 5′-CATCTTCTTTTGCGTCGCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTAAAAGCAGCCCTGGTGACC-3′ (reverse).
2.11. Western Blotting
Total proteins from transfected and untransfected HepG2 cells were extracted using RIPA buffer (Vazyme Biotech, China). BCA assay (Beyotime, China) was conducted to quantify the extracted total proteins. For isolation of the protein samples, 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out followed by transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (0.45  μ m) with 300 mA current for 90 min. After transfer, the membranes were blocked in 5% BSA at ambient temperature for 1 h and then incubated overnight using rabbit antibodies against GPC3 (Abcam, USA; diluted 1 : 1000) and a rabbit antibody against GAPDH (Sangon Biotech, China; diluted 1 : 5000) as an internal standard at 4°C to normalize the protein expressions. On the next day, the membranes were further incubated using goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sangon Biotech, China; diluted 1 : 5000) for 1 h and then subjected to protein visualization using enhanced chemiluminescence (Vazyme Biotech, China). The G:BOX Chemi XX9 imaging system (Syngene, UK) was used for protein visualization.
2.12. Statistical Analysis
Quantitative variables were represented as the mean ± standard deviation ( x ¯  ±  s ).  P  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The data were determined by one-way ANOVA analysis using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software.
