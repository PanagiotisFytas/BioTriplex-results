Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as a malignancy characterized by high incidence and mortality, harms people's life and health in a tremendous manner. Seriously, its mortality and morbidity have been steadily increasing over the last few decades [ 1 ]. To date, chemotherapy remains the most common treatment for all stages of carcinoma patients. However, several potential chemotherapeutics that can treat HCC still show limitations such as severe adverse reactions and drug resistance [ 2 ]. Moreover, the intricacy of the molecular pathogenesis poses great difficulties on seeking cure. Enormous endeavors have thus been made to develop high-efficacy multitarget antineoplastics with less adverse effects.
Several effective plant constituents, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine with insignificant adverse actions, have aroused a wide range of interest as an adjuvant therapy [ 3 ]. Among them, TanIIA, an effective component extracted from the  Salvia miltiorrhiza  roots, features high efficacy, natural source, and low toxicity [ 4 ]. Based on the existing studies on TanIIA, it exerts a broad spectrum of antitumor activities in a variety of human carcinoma cells by suppressing proliferation and migration, triggering autophagy and apoptosis, and reversing the multidrug resistance [ 5 ]. Additionally, TanIIA has a synergistic effect in combination with other chemotherapeutics commonly used in clinics, which makes its application in the cancer and adjuvant therapies promising and offers a new insight into diverse cancer treatments as well [ 6 ].
Unsatisfactorily, being a lipophilic constituent, TanIIA is poorly bioavailable, which limits its further application [ 7 ]. Due to poor water solubility, it exhibits robust hepatic elimination after oral medication and can be easily eliminated from the circulatory system after intravenous medication [ 8 ,  9 ]. Hence, diverse delivery systems (nanoscale) have been proposed for controlled release of TanIIA, in order to overcome its disadvantages and to elevate its bioavailability [ 2 ,  9 ].
Amongst various nano-based drug delivery platforms developed, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have attracted a considerable attention owing to their good biocompatibility, monodispersity, feeble toxicity, tunable pore size, and large pore volumes, among other characteristics [ 10 ]. Despite being in part a potential solution to the foregoing problems with TanIIA, it still cannot escape the influence of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Rapid elimination by the RES will inevitably hamper the nanosized drugs' absorption efficiency in tumor regions, leading to reduced bioavailability [ 11 ]. Being highly hydrophilic and positively charged, PEG is commonly used to decorate nanoparticles [ 12 ], which has been proven as one of the most effective methods to improve nanoparticle biodistribution and reduce opsonization by the RES [ 11 ].
Studies over the last decades have demonstrated that GPC3 is highly and specifically expressed in HCC, revealing its potential from an encouraging biomarker for the early HCC detection to an effective epitope for targeted HCC treatment. Past several years have witnessed the exploration of the GPC3-targeting gene therapies [ 13 ,  14 ]. As promising as it looks, their applications are severely limited because of the physicochemical traits of nucleotide drugs, including high molecular weight, susceptibility to nuclease degradation, easy missing of target, and anionic charge [ 15 ]. This has necessitated carrier design as the gene therapy advances in order to achieve highly efficient drug delivery to the target cells. ShRNAs, the small molecules of RNA, have specific function of gene silencing, which can be delivered to the targets via the support of nanoparticles [ 16 ]. Recently, nanostructured carriers such as PEG and PEI or inorganic nanoparticles have shown multiple advantages concerning RNA interference (RNAi) delivery [ 17 ]. PEI, as one of the most classic nonviral vectors, is the most broadly applied polycation transfection reagent owing to its high stability and transfection performance, while PEI-25k has been considered the gold standard for nonviral vectors [ 18 ,  19 ]. Moreover, PEI combined with PEG could improve the systemic circulation and prolong the treatment time [ 19 ,  20 ].
Based on the aforementioned theory, this study aims to construct an intelligent nanoplatform to improve the water solubility and bioavailability of TanIIA, which also serves as a vehicle of GPC3-shRNA. Herein, we propose a facile method, where TanIIA was physically adsorbed by mesoporous silica and then surface-modified with PEI-PEG to make it positively charged. In this way, the stability of the complex can be improved, which is conducive to loading GPC3-shRNA plasmids. The physicochemical property elucidation of the complex was accomplished,  in vitro  antitumor activities were investigated, and the feasibility of MSN-PEG as a GPC3-shRNA carrier was explored. Finally, we found that this novel drug delivery system is promising for HCC treatment.   Figure 1  is a schematic illustration of the preparation of MSN-PEG nanoparticles and their delivery.
