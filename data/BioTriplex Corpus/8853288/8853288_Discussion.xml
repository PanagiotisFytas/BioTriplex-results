In our previous work, primary cultures of human satellite cells provided to be a useful scientific model to identify biomolecular processes involved in muscle mass loss related to alteration of normal mechanical loading ( Tarantino et al., 2020 ). Indeed, prolonged exposure to no load is known to affect regenerative growth and tissue repair by impairing adult stem cell proliferation and differentiation processes ( Blaber et al., 2014 ). The negative impact of microgravity and ground-based simulation conditions on physiological systems has been confirmed by numerous studies, which report skeletal muscle cell atrophy, inhibition of osteoblast differentiation, reduction in osteoblast number, altered immune cell activation, and abnormal chondrocyte formation as the main harmful effects on cellular function ( Nabavi et al., 2011 ;  Chatziravdeli et al., 2019 ;  Wehland et al., 2020 ;  Ludtka et al., 2021 ). Based on this evidence and taking our previous work as a starting point ( Tarantino et al., 2020 ), we have here evaluated the efficacy of anti-MSTN antibodies in preventing muscle degeneration induced by RPM exposure in primary cultures of human satellite cells, reproducing identical experimental conditions and enriching previously obtained data.
Sarcopenia, a major age-related musculoskeletal disorder, is characterized by quantitative and qualitative changes in the structure and function of the musculoskeletal system. This process is typically slow but, at the same time, inevitable, as it occurs even in healthy, well-nourished, and physically active individuals ( Korhonen et al., 2006 ). Although the biological processes underlying aging have not yet been fully elucidated, several alterations have been observed in aging muscle tissue. For example, in old age there is a significant reorganization of the fibers that make up motor units, with an increase in their size but a reduction in their number. In addition, during the aging process there is a progressive loss of motor neurons, leading to a decline in the neuromuscular system ( Larsson et al., 2019 ). These alterations are associated with others that promote the sarcopenia progression, such as altered microcirculation, mitochondrial damage, and loss of regenerative potential ( Ryan et al., 2006 ;  Degens, 2010 ;  Xu et al., 2021 ). The muscle decline strongly affects bone tropism, mobility, and skeletal system characteristics ( Scimeca et al., 2015 ). Noteworthy, recent studies have reported a strong association between sarcopenia and the occurrence of degenerative bone diseases, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, suggesting a key role of bone–muscle crosstalk in understanding the pathophysiology of sarcopenia ( Tarantino et al., 2015a ;  Cariati et al., 2021 ). Therefore, in this study we included OA and OP patients undergoing hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis and fragility fracture, respectively. In addition, for the CTRL group, we enrolled young patients who had undergone hip arthroplasty for a high-energy fracture but did not suffer from age-related musculoskeletal disorders. During surgery, biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of each patient, to set up primary satellite cell cultures used at first or second passage.
First, satellite cells were characterized by immunofluorescence to assess the expression of Pax7, a key transcriptional regulator expressed by quiescent satellite cells. Then, we performed a morphological analysis by light microscopy to verify the presence of any peculiar features in the three experimental groups. In normogravity conditions, CTRL and OA groups presented a similar appearance, as both cell culture types were characterized by a heterogeneous population of numerous myotubes and rare single satellite cells. In contrast, samples derived from OP patients consisted mostly of single satellite cells and rare myotubes. These results are in line with our previous study conducted on muscle biopsies from OA and OP patients, in which immunohistochemistry showed a higher expression of Pax7 and a better ability to form new fibers in the muscle of OA patients compared to the OP group ( Tarantino et al., 2016 ). In agreement with previous data ( Tarantino et al., 2020 ), RPM exposure influenced cell morphology, as variations in the satellite cell/myotube ratio were found in the three experimental groups. Particularly, a significant increase in the number of myotubes was observed in the OP group.
As demonstrated by  Scimeca et al. (2017) , the imbalance between the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) pathway, which plays a role in controlling the mass and regeneration of adult skeletal muscle, and the myostatin pathway, which acts as a potent negative regulator of muscle growth, could be responsible for the muscle degeneration that characterizes the sarcopenic condition ( Scimeca et al., 2017 ). Specifically,  in vitro  studies have shown that myostatin blocks myoblast proliferation and satellite cell self-renewal by downregulation of MyoD, resulting in inhibition of myogenesis ( Thomas et al., 2000 ). Moreover, it competes for both BMP receptor binding and Smad4 activation, suggesting that muscle quality is strongly influenced by the balance between myostatin and BMPs pathways ( Snijders et al., 2015 ). Based on these evidence, we subjected primary satellite cell cultures to immunocytochemical analysis to assess differences in myostatin expression between the three experimental groups. Not surprisingly, its expression was age-dependent under normogravity conditions, as the lowest myostatin levels were found in CTRL patients, who had a mean age of 45.3 ± 2.6, whereas the OP group, with a mean age of 78.4 ± 2.5, had the highest myostatin levels. RPM exposure induced group-dependent changes in myostatin expression. Specifically, we observed similar levels in myostatin expression in CTRL and OA groups, although with higher values than those measured in normogravity conditions. Surprisingly, a significant reduction in myostatin levels was detected in cell cultures derived from OP patients, with far lower values when compared to those measured under normogravity regime. However, this reduction could be a transient effect due to the mechanical insult, as observed in our previous work, in which TEM analysis showed that RPM exposure induces phenomena of degeneration and cell death in all experimental groups, including the presence of lipofuscin granules, electron dense cytoplasm, and dystrophic calcifications ( Tarantino et al., 2020 ).
Considering the results obtained from morphological evaluation and immunocytochemistry, we hypothesized that myostatin might be the main effector of such degeneration. Therefore, to test whether inactivation of the myostatin pathway was preparatory to blocking/delaying the negative effects of RPM exposure on satellite cells, we subjected primary cultures to treatment with anti-MSTN antibodies for 72 h and then to Toluidine blue staining for morphological analysis. Surprisingly, a significant increase in cell survival was observed in cultures exposed to RPM and treated with anti-MSTN antibodies, in all experimental groups. In detail, myostatin inhibition induced the formation of a pluristrate of myotubes in both CTRL and OA patients. Furthermore, in cell cultures derived from the OP group, where the ability to form myotubes was drastically inhibited, treatment with anti-MSTN antibodies promoted cell aggregation and the tendency to form myotubes even after RPM exposure.
