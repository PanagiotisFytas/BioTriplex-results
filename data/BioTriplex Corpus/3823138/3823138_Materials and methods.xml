Muscle biopsies and ethics statement
Primary human myoblasts, muscle biopsies and surgical muscle surplus during scapular fixation were obtained according to procedures approved by the current ethical and legislative rules of France or Belgium and written informed consent was obtained from all participants, as directed by the ethical committee of CHU de Villeneuve (Montpellier, France) [ 24 ]. In addition, the uses of this material have been approved by the ethics committee of the University of Mons (ref #A901). We used clinical and histopathology criteria as described [ 24 ] to assess whether the biopsied muscle was affected and to evaluate the severity.
Cell Culture
C2C12 (mouse myoblasts) and TE671 (human rhabdomyosarcoma) cells were grown in DMEM high glucose (4.5 g/l) with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (PAA Laboratories) and 10% foetal calf serum (FCS; PAA Laboratories) at 37°C under 5% CO 2 . These cells were transfected with the  pCIneo-DUX4  expression vector to provide a positive control for Western blots ( Figs 5C ,  6A ,  Figs S2A ,  S3  and  S6 ) or with the empty  pCIneo  vector as a negative control ( Fig. S3A ). For transfections, C2C12 cells (5 × 10 5 ) were seeded in a 75 cm 2  flask and transfected 24 hrs later in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 20 μg plasmid and 60 μl Lipofectamin2000 (Invitrogen). TE671 cells (1.2 × 10 6 ) were seeded in a 75 cm 2  flask and transfected 24 hrs later in their culture medium with 10 μg plasmid and 32 μl FuGENE6 (Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Cells were harvested 24 hrs post-transfection.
Primary myoblast cultures from control individuals and patients with FSHD were isolated from muscle biopsies, purified by a selection of CD56 +  cells and established as described [ 24 ]. They were grown in collagen-coated dishes (Iwaki Cell Biology, Tokyo, Japan) in DMEM with high glucose (4.5 g/l), sodium pyruvate and sodium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) with L-glutamine (4 mM; Sigma-Aldrich), Gentamycin (50 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 1% Ultroser G (Pall BioSepra, Cergy-St-Christophe, France) at 37°C under 5% CO 2 . Before experimentation, primary myoblasts were seeded in 10 cm or 35 mm collagen-coated dishes, respectively, for Western blot or immunofluorescence, in DMEM with Gentamycin (50 μg/ml) and 20% FBS. The myogenic differentiation of confluent cells was induced by decreasing the FBS concentration to 2%. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 (25 μM or 50 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the culture medium 5 hrs before harvesting the cells ( Fig. 5 ). For transfection, primary myoblasts were seeded in the growth medium (DMEM/Gentamycin/10% FBS/1% Ultroser G) and transfected 24 hrs after seeding with Fugene HD (Roche Diagnosis) and plasmid DNA at a 6:2 ratio as described [ 19 ]. Myoblasts were then differentiated 5 hrs later by replacing the medium to DMEM/Gentamicin/2% FBS during 3 days ( Fig. 1 ). A ‘reverse transfection’ with SiPORTNeoFX transfection agent (Applied Biosystems, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was used to introduce short interfering (si)RNA against  DUX4  or  DUX4c  ( Fig. S2 ) in primary myoblasts as described in [ 19 ]. Differentiation was induced 5 hrs later as above and cells were fixed for immunofluorescence after 3 days.
Plasmid constructs
The  pCIneo-DUX4  and  pCIneo-DUX4c  expression plasmids were described previously in [ 8 ,  9 ,  13 ] and contain the respective ORF under control of the CMV promoter. The vector used to determine the transfection efficiency by monitoring of green fluorescence was the  pEGFP-N2  (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA).
DUX4 and DUX4c antibodies
The mouse monoclonal antibody against DUX4 (MAb 9A12) was raised against the 253 last residues of the DUX4 carboxyl-terminal domain as described in [ 9 ]. The anti-PITX1 rabbit serum was raised against a PITX1-specific peptide as described in [ 9 ]. The anti-DUX4c rabbit serum was raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide as described in [ 13 ]. The 314 rabbit antiserum was raised against a DUX4-specific peptide corresponding to residues 342–356 as described in [ 17 ].
Immunodetection by Western blot
The following protocol was specifically developed for the detection of the endogenous DUX4 protein with MAb 9A12. Whole-cell extracts of myoblast primary cultures were obtained by lysis in hypertonic buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 1 mM DTT) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) using three freeze/thaw cycles. Nuclear extracts were prepared with the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's procedure except that nuclei were lysed with the hypertonic buffer. Forty μg cell lysate or 20 μg nuclear extract were separated by 10 or 12% PAGE-SDS during 3 to 4 hrs at 100 V and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Diegem, Belgium). The electrotransfert was performed at 4°C in a wet tank with a blotting buffer containing 12.5 mM TRIS, 192 mM Glycine and 20% Methanol, at 160 mA during 90 min. The membrane was stained with Ponceau red to check loading and migration quality, and a picture was taken for loading control. After rinsing in PBS, the Western blot was blocked 1 hr at room temperature in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 5% non-fat dry milk, rinsed in PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C with MAb 9A12 (1:1000) in PBS-BSA 2%. After rinsing in PBS, appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to HRP (1:5000; GE Healthcare) were added and detected with the super signal west femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Thermo Scientific) on Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare).
For immunodetection on muscle biopsy extracts ( Fig. 6 A and  Fig. S6 ), the same protocol was used with the homogenization in the hypertonic buffer. In  Figure 6A , 40 μg (F11 and F7) or 80 μg (F10 and C1) protein extract were loaded. In  Figure S6 , 40 μg of each protein extract was loaded. For the 2D gel analysis, an isoelectrofocalization (IEF) was performed with the IPGphor system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with modifications as described [ 29 ]. Immobiline Dry Strip (pI 3–11), IPG buffer pH 3–11 and electrophoretic reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia. The second dimension was a PAGE-SDS.
Immunofluorescence
Primary myoblasts seeded on 35 mm collagen-coated dishes (Iwaki Cell Biology) were fixed 5 min. at room temperature (RT) in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells permeabilization was performed in PBS 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 min. at RT. After blocking in PBS 20% FBS, cells were incubated with primary antibodies during 2 hrs at RT. The following antibodies and dilutions were used: MAb 9A12 (purified: 1/50 or hybridoma culture medium: 1:1), anti-PITX1 rabbit serum (1/50), anti-DUX4c rabbit serum (1/50), rabbit polyclonal antidesmin ab15200 (1/200; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit MAb anticleaved PARP (1/200, overnight at 4°C; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). After washing and blocking, cells were incubated during 1 hr at RT with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies goat antimouse 488 and antirabbit 555 (1/100; Invitrogen). After washing, cells were covered by 5 μl of Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and by a coverslip.
The detection of DNA fragmentation in DUX4-positive nuclei was performed with the Apoptag Red  In Situ  Apoptosis Detection kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Microscopy
Microscopy images were collected with the following workstations: the Montpellier RIO Imaging facility at the CRBM, Montpellier, France ( http://www.mri.cnrs.fr ); the imagery platform at the IBMM, ULB, Belgium ( http://www.cmmi.be ) and a Nikon Microscope Eclipse 80i with a DS-U3 DS Camera control Unit and the NIS element-BR analysis software. Plan Fluor 20 X, Plan Fluor 40× and 60× Apo-VC high-resolution oil immersion objectives were used with 350-, 480- and 540- nm excitation for the 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) channel respectively.
Quantifications and Statistics
The number of DUX4-positive nuclei ( Fig. 2 B and  Fig. S2C ) was counted from at least 10 random fields (20× objective). The percentage was calculated relatively to the number of DAPI-positive nuclei per field and the histograms represent the percentage mean. The DUX4 intensity mean per field ( Fig. 2 C) was measured using the NIS element-BR analysis software. Intensity values below the threshold (Th: corresponding to DUX4 intensity mean in disorganized culture) are considered as null.
The significance was evaluated by an  anova  test and a multiple comparison of means (Tukey Contrasts) using the ‘R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2.14.0’. An arcsine transformation ( p ′ = arcsin√ p  where  p  = proportion), commonly used for proportions, was applied beforehand to the data. ** P  < 0.01 was considered significant.
