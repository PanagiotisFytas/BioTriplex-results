Title: DNA hypomethylation of the Krüppel-like factor 11 (KLF11) gene promoter: a putative biomarker of depression comorbidity in panic disorder and of non-anxious depression?
Abstract: Panic disorder (PD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders and often occurs comorbidly with major depressive disorder (MDD). Altered methylation of the monoamine oxidase A ( MAOA ) gene has been implicated in the etiology of both PD and MDD. The Krüppel-like factor 11 (KLF11; alias TIEG2), an activating transcription factor of the  MAOA  gene, has been found to be increased in MDD, but has not yet been investigated in PD. In an effort to further delineate the effects of the KLF11–MAOA pathway in anxiety and affective disorders,  KLF11  promoter methylation was analyzed via pyrosequencing of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA isolated from human peripheral blood in two independent samples of PD patients with or without comorbid MDD in a case–control design (sample 1:  N  = 120) as well as MDD patients with and without anxious depression (sample 2:  N  = 170). Additionally, in sample 1,  KLF11  methylation was correlated with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores. No overall association of  KLF11  promoter methylation with PD was detected. However, PD patients with comorbid MDD showed significant hypomethylation relative to both healthy controls ( p  = 0.010) and PD patients without comorbid MDD ( p  = 0.008). Furthermore,  KLF11  methylation was negatively correlated with BDI-II scores in PD patients ( p  = 0.013). MDD patients without anxious features showed nominally decreased  KLF11  methylation in comparison to MDD patients with anxious depression ( p  = 0.052). The present results suggest  KLF11  promoter hypomethylation as a potential epigenetic marker of MDD comorbidity in PD or of non-anxious depression, respectively, possibly constituting a differential pathomechanism in anxiety and mood disorders.
