Sample 1
In the overall case–control comparison between PD patients and healthy controls, no significant differences in average methylation or in DNA methylation at single CpG sites was discerned (see Table  1 ). Secondary analyses comparing PD patients with and without comorbid MDD indicated significant group differences for average methylation ( p  = 0.049) and methylation at CpG3 ( p  = 0.041). Follow-up tests revealed significantly decreased methylation in PD patients with comorbid MDD (PD + MDD;  N  = 27) regarding average  KLF11  methylation ( p  = 0.008) and CpG site 3 methylation ( p  = 0.006) compared to PD patients without comorbid MDD as well as compared to healthy controls, again regarding average methylation ( p  = 0.010) and methylation at CpG site 3 ( p  = 0.006) (see Table  2 , Fig.  1 ). Conversely, PD patients without comorbid MDD diagnosis (PDonly;  N  = 30) did not differ from healthy controls with regard to  KLF11  average methylation and methylation at single CpG sites (all  p  > 0.05; see Table  2 ).

On a dimensional level, a negative correlation of  KLF11  average methylation with BDI-II scores was observed in the patient group ( ρ  = − 0.336;  p  = 0.013; see Fig.  2 ).

Sample 2
Significant differences in  KLF11  DNA methylation were observed between MDD patients with and without anxious depression at CpG site 1 ( p  = 0.041) and, on a nominally significant level, with regard to average methylation ( p  = 0.052) and methylation at CpG sites 2–4 ( p  = 0.053-0.081; see Table  3 ; Fig.  3 ), with patients with non-anxious depression showing decreased  KLF11  methylation.
