Samples
  consisted of 60 Caucasian (for at least two preceding generations) patients with PD (47 females; age [mean ± SD]: 34.28 ± 9.49 years) with ( N  = 28, 46.6%) or without agoraphobia, and 60 healthy controls matched by age (mean ± SD: 34.30 ± 9.25 years;  t  = 0.01,  df  = 118,  p  = 0.992) and sex (47 females; Χ 2  = 0.0,  df  = 1,  p  = 1.0). PD diagnosis was confirmed by experienced clinical psychologists on the basis of a clinical interview according to DSM-IV criteria (SCID-I; Wittchen et al.  1997 ). The presence of current comorbid axis I diagnoses other than bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, current alcohol dependence, current abuse of or dependence on benzodiazepines and other psychoactive substances was tolerated if PD was the primary diagnosis (MDD:  N  = 28; social anxiety disorder:  N  = 3; specific phobias:  N  = 2). Further exclusion criteria were current or past internal or neurological somatic illnesses, intake of any somatic medication, illegal drugs including cannabis (assessed by urine toxicology), pregnancy and excessive alcohol (> 15 glasses of alcohol per week) or nicotine (> 20 cigarettes per day) consumption. Thirty-four (56.7%) patients were on stable psychiatric medication with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs,  N  = 18), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs,  N  = 5), a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA,  N  = 7), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs,  N  = 7), pregabaline ( N  = 2), quetiapine ( N  = 2), or zopiclone ( N  = 1). No patient received monoamine oxidase inhibitors or valproate. Smoking status was assessed in the patient (smokers:  N  = 19) and control groups ( N  = 18). In the control group, absence of current and/or lifetime DSM-IV mental axis I disorders was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.; Sheehan et al.  1998 ). The severity of depressive symptoms in patients was assessed using the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Hautziger et al.  2009 ). All participants were recruited at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Würzburg, Germany, within the Collaborative Research Centre SFB-TRR-58 ‘Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders’, project C02.
  comprised 170 Caucasian patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD; 98 females; age [mean ± SD]: 44.61 ± 14.86 years) with (≥ 7 on the anxiety/somatization factor of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; cf. Fava et al.  2008 ; Domschke et al.  2010 ;  N  = 99, 58.24%) or without anxious depression. MDD diagnosis was determined by experienced clinical psychologists or psychiatrists based on medical records and a structured clinical interview according to DSM-IV criteria (SCID-I; Wittchen et al.  1997 ). Exclusion criteria were current obsessive–compulsive disorder, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis or dementia, and/or presence of substance abuse disorder or eating disorder currently or within the last 10 years. Smoking status was assessed in the overall sample (smokers:  N  = 52, 30.59%).  N  = 135 (79.4%) patients received psychiatric medication with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs,  N  = 48), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs,  N  = 48), a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA,  N  = 36), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs,  N  = 26), a noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI,  N  = 6), neuroleptics ( N  = 33), anticonvulsants ( N  = 12), benzodiazepines ( N  = 13), lithium ( N  = 7), or tianeptine ( N  = 1). No patient received monoamine oxidase inhibitors or valproate. All participants were recruited at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Würzburg, Germany.
This study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Würzburg, Germany, and was conducted according to the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
  DNA methylation analysis
Venous blood samples were collected from all participants using standardized EDTA tubes. DNA extractions from frozen whole blood were accomplished using either FlexiGene ®  DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or a standardized salting out procedure (Miller et al.  1988 ). After pre-analysis of a 313 bp-long  KLF11  promoter region (chr2:10,182,891–10,183,204; GRCh37/hg19 Assembly, UCSC Genome Browser) by Sanger sequencing (LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany) according to previous studies (e.g., Domschke et al.  2012 ; Ziegler et al.  2016 ; Schiele et al.  2018 ,  2019 ,  2020 ), a 72 bp amplicon containing part of the  KLF11  promoter (five CpGs) upstream of exon I (chr2:10,183,094–10,183,166; GRCh37/hg19 Assembly, UCSC Genome Browser) was chosen for further DNA methylation analyses, given that only these five CpG sites showed a considerable variance in their mean methylation level and thus seemed to be suitable for subsequent DNA methylation analyses by pyrosequencing.
Aliquots (500 ng) of isolated genomic DNA were treated with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect ®  96 Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and processed in randomized order to avoid possible batch effects. Non-methylated and fully methylated EpiTect ®  PCR Control DNA Sets (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used as a control for successful bisulfite conversion.
The 72 bp amplicon (10,183,094–10,183,166; GRCh37/hg19 Assembly, UCSC Genome Browser) was amplified via PCR according to a standard pyrosequencing PCR protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The obtained DNA strand was sequenced and quantitatively analyzed by pyrosequencing using PyroMark ®  Q96 ID System (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All samples were tested in duplicate to check for run variability resulting in a mean methylation score for each CpG site as well as an individual standard deviation (SD) for each duplicate. For quality control, SD > 0.1 of each duplicate was used as exclusion criterion. Additionally, outliers (≥ 3*SD from mean methylation of respective CpG site) were defined as second exclusion criterion. In each sample,  N  = 6 participants had to be excluded from the reported analyses according to these criteria.
The obtained electropherograms were robustly readable for all five CpG sites, and CpG sites were numbered according to their GRCh37/hg19 Primary Assembly position: CpG1 = chr2:10,183,094; CpG2 = chr2:10,183,106; CpG3 = chr2:10,183,115; CpG4 = chr2:10,183,125; CpG5 = chr2:10,183,140 (all genomic locations according to GRCh37/hg19 Assembly, UCSC Genome Browser).
Statistical analysis
Differences in dimensional sample characteristics were tested by means of independent samples  t  tests, and differences in categorical variables by means of Chi-square tests.  KLF11  methylation (average methylation, single CpG sites) between PD patients and controls (sample 1) and between MDD patients with anxious and non-anxious depression (sample 2), respectively, was compared by means of non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test. Correlations between  KLF11  methylation and BDI-II scores in sample 1 were evaluated by means of Spearman correlations ( ρ ). Since no associations between average  KLF11  methylation and sex (sample 1:  t 112  = 1.056,  p  = 0.293; sample 2:  t 162  = − 0.137,  p  = 0.891), age (sample 1:  r  = 0.156;  p  = 0.097; sample 2:  r  = 0.054;  p  = 0.495), smoking status (sample 1:  t 112  = 0.745,  p  = 0.458; sample 2:  t 161  = 1.213;  p  = 0.227), or medication intake (sample 1:  t 57  = 1.384,  p  = 0.172; sample 2:  t 162  = − 0.123,  p  = 0.902) were found in either sample, analyses were not controlled for these variables. The significance level was set at  p  ≤ 0.05. Given the present proof-of-concept approach and high correlation between single CpG sites (data not shown), no correction for multiple testing was applied when analyzing single CpG sites and average  KLF11  methylation (cf. Schiele et al.  2018 ).
