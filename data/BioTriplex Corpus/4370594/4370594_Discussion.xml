Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare malignancy that is difficult to diagnose and treat. Recent advances have led to improved outcomes through a combination of systemic chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. An understanding of the molecular biology of this disease is growing, but has not yet led to effective targeted therapy. The Personalized OncoGenomics initiative at the British Columbia Cancer Agency provides a unique opportunity to learn how to best analyze, interpret and apply rapidly emerging molecular information in the clinic. This approach to personalized medicine is in its infancy, and there is much to be learned from the wealth of molecular data generated, particularly in rare tumor types.
Comparing patients 1 and 2, similarities include loss-of-function mutations in  NF2 , a well-characterized tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in mesotheliomas. Interestingly, high expression of the  MET , tyrosine kinase receptor was observed in both cases, with subsequent dysregulation of the downstream PI3K-mTOR pathway. The possibility of targeted treatment towards this cell-signaling pathway is an attractive option, and has been discussed and explored by others.[ 22 , 23 , 24 ] A single common mutation in the  contactin associated protein-like 3B  ( CNTNAP3B , M1247I, COSM1472297) gene was shared between the two patients; the significance of this is not clear. Mutations in this gene have been reported to occur at low frequencies in tumors of the thyroid (0.98% of cases tested), prostate (0.38% of cases), and lung (0.21% of cases).[ 25 ]
The clinical and molecular differences between the two cases were notable. Patient 1 presented at a younger age, with significant clinical symptoms, a high disease burden and epithelioid histology, yet responded poorly to therapy and died within 8 months of diagnosis. In contrast, patient 2 presented with minimal clinical symptoms, was diagnosed with a poor prognosis sarcomatoid peritoneal mesothelioma, but had an excellent response to treatment, and remains clinically well and disease-free following multimodality therapy. This somewhat paradoxical excellent response to platinum-based chemotherapy in a patient predicted to have poor prognosis has been previously reported in the literature, also in a patient with sarcomatoid peritoneal mesothelioma.[ 26 ] Based upon this report and one other, sarcomatoid histology on biopsy may not necessarily exclude the possibility of a favorable outcome, suggesting that peritoneal mesothelioma of sarcomatoid histology should not automatically exclude patients from aggressive medical and surgical treatment. Additional studies are warranted to further explore this possibility.
The molecular data from patient 2 were probed extensively for possible explanations for the brisk response to therapy. The chemotherapy-responsive component of the tumor showed sarcomatoid histology and contained 151 unique mutations, while the chemotherapy-resistant component showed an epithelioid histology with 167 unique mutations. Subsets of genetic changes present in the responsive and nonresponsive elements were examined for any possible mechanism for chemotherapy resistance or sensitivity without success.
It is notable that when comparing whole genome sequencing data from the two patients, only 18 SNVs were identified in the tumor samples from patient 1, as compared to 434 SNVs in the samples from patient 2. This is a striking difference, even when accounting for the fact that patient 2 had an additional tumor sample submitted for molecular analysis. These findings suggest that a hypermutated phenotype of peritoneal mesothelioma may exist, similar to previously described mismatch-repair unstable colorectal cancers, or tobacco-associated lung cancers.[ 27 ]
Hypermutation may be defined as a subset of tumors that show an increased rate of mutation as compared to their non-hypermutated counterparts. In peritoneal mesothelioma, there is a paucity of information regarding the overall mutation rate of these tumors, making a strict definition difficult. In colorectal carcinoma, a well-studied example of hypermutation, mutation rates greater than 12/megabase (Mb) have been previously used as cutoffs.[ 28 ] By this cutoff, neither of these cases would be considered hypermutated (mutation rates of 0.8/Mb and 5.7/Mb in patients 1 and 2 respectively). Alternatively, in a recent review of hypermutation, Roberts and Gordenin considered a cutoff of greater than 10,000 single nucleotide changes,[ 29 ] a cutoff that includes patient 2 (16,329 single nucleotide changes identified). Many factors come into play when establishing a strict definition for hypermutation, for example the proliferation rate of the tumor, and the method of DNA sequencing.
In patient 2, somatic hypermutation was associated with platinum sensitivity and favorable prognosis, similar to findings from studies in other tumor types.[ 30 ] Other frequently hypermutated cancers are associated with defects in DNA repair machinery, or ongoing mutagenesis by an external carcinogen. Neither a DNA-repair defect nor a source of ongoing inflammation or carcinogen exposure was identified in the genomic data or clinical history of patient 2. The right-colonic tumor sample from patient 2 was obtained after 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Although possible that the observed number of mutation is elevated secondary to chemotherapeutic effect, this is unlikely as the number of mutations in the pretreated vaginal sample is similar (283 and 267 coding mutations respectively). Analysis of the 283 coding SNVs, as well as 16,046 noncoding SNVs from the right colonic tumor sample, and their flanking base pairs was performed and compared to the distinct mutational signatures presented in Alexandrov  et al .[ 21 ]. This analysis showed a prevalence of C>T transitions at NCG trinucleotide sequences, a mutational signature related to cytosine deamination which is observed in a wide variety of tumor types and not known to be associated with a specific etiology. No known chemotherapy-induced or DNA-repair deficiency hypermutation signatures were identified.
In conclusion, the elucidation and publication of whole-genome sequencing data represent a crucial milestone in the understanding of peritoneal mesothelioma. Data presented in this report provide further evidence for the role of tumor suppressor genes such as  CDKN2A ,  NF2  in the pathogenesis of peritoneal mesothelioma, and presents several other mutations that may also play key roles in the natural history of this disease. The clinical-molecular correlation depicted in this report points to the existence of important prognostic factors which extend beyond the classically utilized epithelioid versus sarcomatoid histology. Peritoneal mesothelioma remains a rare and challenging entity to treat, however, efforts such as personalized oncogenomics will continue to offer novel insights into the biology of this and other rare diseases.
