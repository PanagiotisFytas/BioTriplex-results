Here we report a comprehensive analysis of OS-induced aberrant splicing of multiple exons of  SMN2 , an ubiquitously expressed human gene associated with SMA, which is the most frequent genetic cause of infant mortality. We employed a healthy transgenic (TG) mouse model to assess the tissue-specific effect of PQ-induced OS on splicing of various  SMN2  exons. We chose PQ based on its classical usage across different animal species to study the molecular mechanisms of OS [ 68 – 70 ]. In a most revealing manner, our results of MESDA, RT-PCR and QPCR demonstrated body-wide susceptibility of various  SMN2  exons to OS conditions in TG mice (Figs  1 – 4 ;  S2 Fig ). Barring testis, all tissues exposed to PQ showed near total disappearance of the FL transcript, while transcripts in which exon 7 was skipped alone or together with exon 5 were the major splice isoforms. Of note, while levels of ΔC5,7 transcript significantly increased in a tissue-independent manner, level of ΔC7 transcript was not significantly affected by OS ( Fig 3 ). These results suggest that the OS-induced skipping of exon 7 triggered skipping of exon 5 or vice versa. The effect of OS on  SMN2  exon 3 splicing was also tissue-independent ( Fig 3 ). The skipping of this exon predominantly occurred in combination with the skipping of other exon(s). Splicing of  Sbp2  exons 3/3a suggested that the conditions of OS could favor usage of an alternative splice site within an existing exon. However, none of the OS-induced  SMN2  splicing events was associated with an alternative splice site usage.
The results of MESDA indicate that expression of ΔC7 and ΔC5,7 transcripts in the liver of TG mice peaked at 8 h and 24 h post PQ treatment, respectively ( Fig 1B ). It is likely that early skipping of  SMN2  exon 7 in OS is brought about by sudden change in the posttranslational modifications and/or nuclear import/export of splicing factors, whereas delayed skipping of exon 5 is affected by subsequent changes, such as a slow rate of transcription elongation. Generally, a faster rate of transcription elongation favors exon skipping due to the lack of time for the recruitment of factors that define splice sites [ 71 ]. Our finding of an OS-induced reduction in the retention of intron 1, the largest  SMN  intron, might support that a slow elongating RNA polymerase II helps recruit critical splicing factor(s) for a fast removal of intron 1. However, a slow elongating RNA polymerase II may also recruit negative factors, leading to enhanced skipping of downstream exons. Consistently, a recent report supports recruitment of an inhibitory factor during slow transcription elongation leading to the skipping of exon 9 of CFTR [ 72 ]. It is possible that slow removal of intron 1 under normal conditions is designed to hold the partially spliced  SMN  transcripts in the nucleus until other introns are excised. However, it remains to be seen how the rate of  SMN  transcription affects the splicing of various  SMN  exons.
Transcription and splicing of a large number of genes are differently regulated in mammalian testis [ 73 , 74 ]. We have recently shown that the levels of Smn protein in testis of mice are more than a magnitude higher than in most tissues, including brain, spinal cord, heart, liver, lung and kidney [ 32 ]. It appears that the high level of SMN in human testis is maintained at least in part due to the presence of  SMN2  that goes through an adult-specific splicing switch to generate mostly FL transcripts [ 32 ]. While the mechanism of this unique splicing switch remains to be uncovered, we hypothesize that the high level of SMN in testis is necessary to maintain the sufficient levels of functional snRNPs for the heightened splicing activity during spermatogenesis. In addition, low SMN causes c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway activation that is associated with the testicular toxicity [ 23 , 75 , 76 ]. Therefore, maintaining a high level of SMN in testis is critical for sustaining general testicular health. It is known that low SMN exacerbates skipping of  SMN2  exon 7 [ 77 ]. Hence, high SMN level might at least partly contribute to the prevention of OS-induced skipping of  SMN2  exons in testis. In addition, it is possible that splicing factors responsible for the splicing switch of  SMN2  in this organ are not affected by PQ-induced OS. It is also likely that the blood testis barrier is less permeable to PQ. Hence, PQ might not penetrate the testis in amount sufficient enough to produce a significant effect on splicing of the  SMN2  exons. Supporting this argument, an early study on PQ poisoning in Crete detected markedly less PQ accumulation in testis compared to other tissues, including kidney, liver and lung [ 78 ].
Promoters of human  SMN  and mouse  Smn  genes share several but not all motifs [ 79 ]. However, since none of the  Smn  exons showed skipping under the normal and OS conditions ( Fig 2B ), we hypothesize that human-specific promoter elements and/or cis-elements within transcribed pre-mRNA are the driving force of splicing regulation of  SMN  exons. While a direct role of a promoter element(s) on splicing of  SMN  exons is yet to be established, a number of exonic and intronic cis-elements that weaken the 3′ and 5′ ss of  SMN2  exon 7 have been implicated in skipping  SMN2  exon 7 [ 63 ]. It has also been shown that the sequestration of a negative cis-element by an 8-mer ASO prevents skipping of  SMN2  exon 7 under normal and OS conditions [ 41 , 80 – 82 ]. Hence, a correlation could be drawn between a suboptimal splice site and susceptibility to aberrant splicing under conditions of OS. Genome-wide analyses show the prevalence of R (purines) and G residues at the first and the last positions of human exons, respectively [ 53 ]. In our study, most exons susceptible to skipping induced by OS lacked the favorable residues at the first and the last positions of exons ( Fig 5A ). Lack of a G residue at the last position of an exon weakens the base pairing between U1 RNA and the 5′ ss. In several cases we examined, the RNA:RNA duplex formed between U1 RNA and the 5′ ss appeared to be weak due to less than six continuous base pairs ( Fig 5A ). Exons that were susceptible to inclusion induced by OS appeared to have favorable residues at the terminal exonic positions. Yet, the 5′ ss of most of these exons had poor base pairing with U1 RNA ( Fig 5A ). We have previously shown an inhibitory structural context as one of the limiting factors for skipping of  SMN2  exon 7 [ 83 ]. Most of the exons we examined had predicted stem-loop structures that sequester their 5′ ss ( Fig 5C ). We also observed enrichment of several motifs within OS-sensitive exons and their flanking intronic sequences ( S5 Fig ). The compositions of enriched motifs in skipping-prone exons were distinct from those in inclusion-prone exons. Future experiments will determine how these motifs cooperate to regulate alternative splicing under OS.
OS caused a small but statistically significant decrease in hSMN protein derived from  SMN2 . Due to the insertion of a protein degradation signal upon skipping of exon 7 [ 19 ], we were unable to detect proteins translated from aberrantly spliced  SMN2  transcripts, the majority of which lacked exon 7. Despite being translation compatible, none of the alternatively spliced variants of human  SMN  have been assigned any specific function. It is possible that  SMN2  transcripts generated under OS play some role. For example, the short  SMN2  isoforms could act as long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). One of the critical functions of lncRNAs is to serve as competing RNAs to sequester microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins [ 84 , 85 ]. Considering FL and truncated  SMN2  transcripts generated under OS possess identical 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs), they might compete for the same factors that regulate translation via 3′UTRs. Therefore, the reason for only a small reduction in FL SMN level despite a significant drop in level of FL transcript could be the enhanced translation of FL transcripts due to the 3′UTRs of the short  SMN2  transcripts generated under OS acting as a “sponge” for the inhibitory microRNA.
Even though we did not capture a major shift in OS-induced expression of several splicing factors, we did observe a small but significant decrease in levels of TIA1 and hnRNP A2. These proteins have the opposite effects on  SMN2  exon 7 splicing [ 82 ]. While TIA1 promote inclusion of exon 7, hnRNP A2 promotes exclusion of exon 7. Although not statistically significant, we also observed a noticeable increase in the level of SRp55. The role of SRp55 has been implicated in the inhibition of the 5′ ss of exon 3 of HIV-1 vpr mRNA [ 65 ]. Recently, SRp55 was shown to inhibit  SMN  exon 7 splicing [ 67 ]. Changes in the levels of splicing factors described in this study do not fully capture the overall mechanistic aspects by which splicing of various  SMN  exons are regulated under normal and OS conditions. Future studies should focus on how splicing of specific  SMN  exons are regulated. Despite the fact that an overwhelming OS-induced skipping of  SMN2  exon 7 (together with exon 5) was recorded in most tissues, it wouldn’t be surprising that an entirely different set of splicing factors are involved in splicing of these exons in different tissues. Evidence supporting this argument comes from our parallel experiment with  Sbp2 . Every tissue examined showed a different pattern of  Sbp2  exon 3/3a usage under OS conditions ( Fig 2C ).
Our proteome analysis revealed downregulation of hnRNP H as one of the consequences of PQ-induced OS ( Fig 7 ). Our follow-up experiments suggested that the differential expression of hnRNP H captured in the proteome analysis is likely due to a posttranslational modification(s). In addition to its effect on splicing, there are other mechanisms by which hnRNP H could regulate level of SMN under normal and OS conditions. For instance, the involvement of hnRNP H in regulation of 3′-end processing has been shown for human β-globin and p53 transcripts [ 86 , 87 ]. Interestingly, a transcriptome-wide analysis employing CLIP-seq revealed direct interaction of hnRNP H with  SMN  exon 8 [ 88 ]. Future studies will determine if hnRNP H plays any role in splicing and/or 3′-end processing of  SMN  transcripts. While this is the first in vivo study to show the effect of a single high dose of an OS-inducing agent on splicing of various exons of  SMN  in different tissues, outcomes are likely to vary if animals are exposed to an OS-inducing agent for a longer duration. Also, the background and/or the age group of mice are likely to influence the effect of OS on splicing of various  SMN  exons. Addressing these questions will provide a better understanding of the role of SMN in diseases caused by OS.
