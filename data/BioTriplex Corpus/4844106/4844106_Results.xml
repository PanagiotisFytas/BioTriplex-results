Time and dose-dependent signatures of oxidative-stress-induced splice isoforms of  SMN2
To analyze the impact of OS on splicing of  SMN2  pre-mRNA in vivo, we used a previously described transgenic (TG) mouse model that carries the human  SMN2  transgene on the  Smn +/-  background [ 25 ]. Since the  Smn  gene is equivalent to human  SMN1 , this TG model is ideal for testing the impact of OS on  SMN2  splicing in the presence of normal levels of SMN protein. To induce OS in vivo and reliably capture the majority of splicing events at early time points, we treated TG mice with a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 70 mg/kg of PQ. This dose was selected based on a previous study [ 43 ]. Of note, barring few exceptions, most mice survived beyond 24 h of the PQ treatment ( S1A Fig ). Since we did not observe gender-specific differences in  SMN2  splicing outside the sex organs, males and females were analyzed together. Each treatment group was comprised of four animals: two males and two females. To confirm that OS conditions were induced in PQ treated mice, we monitored the level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adducts and phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) in brain samples. Both 4-HNE and pAKT are considered markers of OS [ 47 , 48 ]. Confirming the OS status in the brain, we observed an increase in the levels of 4-HNE and pAKT as early as 8 hours after PQ administration ( S1B and S1C Fig ).
To capture the earliest effect of OS on splicing of  SMN2 , we performed MESDA using liver samples harvested at different time points post PQ injection. Liver was chosen based on a consideration that it would have the fastest uptake of PQ delivered through IP route. To reduce the background, we used  SMN2 -specific primer to generate cDNA. As shown in  Fig 1B , OS-induced changes in splicing of  SMN2  appeared as early as 8 h post PQ injection. In particular, we observed more than 50% decrease in the levels of the FL transcript, with a concomitant 2-fold increase in co-skipping of exons 5 and 7, while skipping of exon 7 increased by ~15% ( Fig 1B ). At 12 h post PQ treatment, the relative amount of splice isoforms remained similar to that of 8 h post PQ treatment ( Fig 1B ). However, at 24 h time point, there was a near total loss of the FL transcript accompanied by further increase in co-skipping of  SMN2  exons 5 and 7 ( Fig 1B ). At 36 h post PQ treatment, the levels of the FL transcript began to increase with simultaneous reduction in the levels of Δ5,7 transcripts; however, transcript levels were not fully restored even 48 h after PQ injection ( Fig 1B ). These results underscore that co-skipping of  SMN2  exons 5 and 7 is a signature event of PQ-induced OS observed during the first 24 h of treatment. Interestingly, 70 mg/kg treatment resulted in noticeably higher levels of Δ3–7 and Δ3–5,7 transcripts 8 and 12 h post injection, respectively, in two out of 20 samples ( Fig 1B , lanes 7 and 9). We also detected several faint bands corresponding to splice isoforms in which multiple exons were simultaneously skipped; most of these isoforms lacked exon 3 and/or exon 5 ( Fig 1B ). Our results also revealed novel splice isoforms generated during the conditions of OS, such as Δ5–7, Δ3,5–7, Δ3–5,7 and Δ3–7 ( Fig 1B , marked with pound signs). GenBank accession numbers of various  SMN  splice isoforms generated under normal and OS conditions are given in  Table 1 .
Based on our results described above we chose 24 h post PQ injection as the time point to collect samples for analysis of all aberrantly spliced  SMN2  variants. Of note, we did not take later time points to avoid the impact of secondary effects on splicing. The effect of PQ-induced OS on splicing of various  SMN2  exons was minimal, marginal and substantial at low (10 mg/kg), medium (25 mg/kg) and high (50 mg/kg) doses of PQ, respectively ( Fig 1C ). At 50 mg/kg treatment, we detected greatly increased levels of Δ5,7, Δ3,7 and Δ3,5,7 splice variants in liver of one out of four animals ( Fig 1C , lane 15). These findings underscore individual variations in susceptibility of  SMN2  exons to skipping under OS. Overall, our results confirmed that co-skipping of exons 5 and 7 is the hallmark of  SMN2  aberrant splicing under the severe conditions of OS (50 and 70 mg/kg PQ treatment). However, under milder OS conditions induced by lower PQ (25mg/kg), increased skipping of  SMN2  exon 7 was the major event ( Fig 1C ).
Tissue-specific effect of oxidative stress on splicing of various exons of  SMN2
We next examined the tissue-specific effect of OS on splicing of  SMN2  exons. We performed this analysis on various tissues collected 24 h post PQ injection (70 mg/kg; IP route). A representative example of MESDA is shown in  Fig 2A . As expected, the Δ7 transcript was the major splice isoform in brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle and spinal cord of untreated animals, followed by the FL transcript ( Fig 2A ). The relative amount of Δ5,7 variant was a distant third in all untreated samples. However, we observed a near total disappearance of the FL transcript accompanied by an increase in the levels of Δ5,7 transcript in all organs and tissues harvested from PQ-treated mice ( Fig 2A ). Co-skipping of exon 5 and 7 was highest in brain and spinal cord (4 and 3.5 times increase, respectively) and lowest in heart and muscle (~ 2 times increase) ( Fig 2A ). Interestingly, heart and muscle were the only two organs in which PQ treatment resulted in a more than 10% increase in individual skipping of exon 7 ( Fig 2A , Δ7 transcript). The levels of individual skipping of exon 5 and exon 3 were extremely low across all samples tested. Visual inspection of the gel indicated that PQ treatment decreased individual skipping of exon 5 and exon 3 ( Fig 2A ). With respect to the shorter splice variants, the levels of Δ3,7 and Δ3,5,7 transcripts were affected the most, particularly in lung ( Fig 2A ). However, these transcripts represented only a very small fraction of  SMN2  splice isoforms. As for the novel splicing events, the conditions of OS led to a small but noticeable increase in co-skipping of exons 5, 6 and 7, particularly in spinal cord ( Fig 2A ). At the same time, the levels of other novel splice variants, such as Δ3–7, Δ3,5–7 and Δ3–5,7 appeared to be largely unaffected by OS. When MESDA was performed with primers specific to mouse  Smn , no effect of OS on splicing of any of the mouse  Smn  exons was observed in any of the tissues tested ( Fig 2B ).
To independently validate the results of MESDA, we analyzed transcripts by PCR employing primers that annealed to flanking exonic sequences of each individual alternatively spliced exon. Here again, we used  SMN2 -specific primers to generate cDNA. We first examined the splicing pattern of  SMN2  exon 7 that has the highest propensity of skipping under normal and OS conditions ( Fig 2A , lanes 1–14). Confirming the results of MESDA, we observed overwhelming skipping of  SMN2  exon 7 in tissues harvested from the PQ-treated animals ( S2B Fig ). We next determined the splicing pattern of  SMN2  exon 5 by PCR using forward and reverse primers that annealed to exons 4 and 6, respectively. Consistent with the results of MESDA, PQ-induced OS caused small but noticeable skipping of  SMN2  exon 5 in all tissues tested ( S2C Fig ). Finally, we examined splicing of  SMN2  exons 2a, 2b and 3 by PCR employing forward and reverse primers that annealed to exons 1 and 4, respectively. PQ-induced OS produced small but noticeable skipping of  SMN2  exon 3 in all tissues examined ( S2D Fig ). Once again, these findings were consistent with the results of MESDA. Parallel experiments on  Smn  did not show any noticeable effect of OS on splicing of exons 3, 5 and 7 in any tissue examined ( S2B–S2D Fig ).
While MESDA revealed susceptibility of various  SMN2  exons to skipping under OS, we did not identify an OS-induced usage of an alternative splice site (ss) within any of the  SMN2  exons. We have previously shown the usage of an alternative 3′ ss within exon 3 of  Secis-Binding Protein 2  ( SBP2 ) transcripts [ 49 ].  SBP2  is a housekeeping gene responsible for the synthesis of selenoproteins in higher organisms [ 50 ]. SBP2 is also implicated in prolonging cell survival under OS [ 51 ]. We used  Sbp2  as a model to examine the OS-induced usage of the alternative 3′ ss in various tissues of TG mice. Of note, usage of an alternative 3′ ss within exon 3 causes skipping of exon 3a (the 5′ portion of exon 3), leading to the generation of a SBP2 isoform targeted to the mitochondria ( Fig 2C ) [ 49 ]. Our results show that PQ treatment enhanced skipping of  Sbp2  exon 3a in brain, kidney, muscle and spinal cord of TG mice ( Fig 2C ). We also observed the highest increase in skipping of exon 3 in lung of PQ-treated TG mice ( Fig 2C ). The kidney emerged as a unique tissue in which PQ enhanced skipping of both exons 3 and 3a ( Fig 2C ). Interestingly, OS did not affect either of these exons in liver, suggesting that factors responsible for the skipping of exons 3 or 3a are absent in this tissue ( Fig 2C ). Skipping of exon 3a in brain and several other tissues is possible only when the 3′ ss of exon 3b is strengthened with respect to the 3′ ss of exon 3. While intronic and exonic sequences at the 3′ ss of exon 3 are represented by U- and A-rich motifs, respectively, intronic and exonic sequences at the 3′ ss of exon 3b are represented by C-rich motifs ( S3A Fig ). Both exons 3 and 3b of  Sbp2  share the same 5′ ss that forms extensive base pairing with U1 snRNA, a component of U1 snRNP ( S3B Fig ); however, the 5′ ss of exons 3/3b is predicted to be sequestered in a stem-loop structure that may in part account for an OS-induced skipping of  Sbp2  exon 3 in kidney and lung ( S3C Fig ). In contrast to the skipping of  SMN2  exon 7, none of the exons of  Sbp2  showed universal skipping under OS. Of note, there are noticeable differences between mouse and human  SBP2  exon 3 and flanking intronic sequences ( S3A Fig ). Consequently, we did not observe any PQ-induced skipping of  SBP2  exon 3a in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells ( S3D Fig ). We also determined splicing of  SBP2  exons 3/3a in cultured HEK-293 cells treated with PQ. Considering HEK-239 cells are derived from human embryonic kidney, the splicing pattern of  SBP2  exons 3/3a was consistent with splicing of mouse  Sbp2  exons 3/3a in kidney (compare  S3D Fig  with  Fig 2C ). These results suggest that motifs responsible for the kidney-specific splicing regulation of  SBP2  exons 3/3a are conserved between human and mice.
Oxidative stress alters the cumulative frequency of several splicing events
To analyze the cumulative frequency of skipping of a specific  SMN2  exon, we employed quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR). To determine the levels of total  SMN2  transcripts, we used forward and reverse primer that annealed to exon 1 and the exon 1/exon 2a junction, respectively ( Fig 3A ). We chose this primer combination based on the fact that neither exon 1 nor exon 2a is alternatively spliced ( S2D Fig ). To evaluate one- or two-exon skipping events, we used primer sets in which at least one primer annealed to an exon-exon junction ( Fig 3A ). Of note, using a wild type mouse as a control, we confirmed that our primer combinations do not amplify  Smn  transcripts. Final values were normalized against the geometric mean of three non-fluctuating controls in the same tissue [ 44 ]. The results were expressed in terms of relative abundance of transcripts in normal and OS conditions ( Fig 3B ). Since oligo(dT) 12-18  was used to prepare cDNA, all transcripts analyzed in this study were polyadenylated. Our results revealed that PQ-induced OS does not alter the overall levels of  SMN2  transcripts in any tissue except heart, where a small but statistically significant increase was observed ( Fig 3B ). Considering data were normalized against the internal controls, our results of QPCR should be interpreted with caution. For instance, a general decline in the rate of transcription due to an energy deficit created by OS will not be reflected.
Consistent with the results of MESDA ( Fig 2A ), we observed a substantial decline in the levels of FL transcript (+5,7 variant) with a concomitant increase in the levels of Δ5,7 splice variant in all examined tissues of PQ-treated animals ( Fig 3B ). At the same time, the levels of Δ7 transcript were not affected by the conditions of OS in any samples except for heart. In this organ, skipping of exon 7 increased slightly but significantly ( Fig 3B ). Further, individual skipping of exon 5 showed a trend of decreasing under OS, although this decrease was not statistically significant ( Fig 3B ). Of note, Ct value for amplification of this transcript was highest (between 34 and 37) among all splice variants whose levels we tested by QPCR. The results of QPCR also revealed that OS induced by PQ promoted skipping of  SMN2  exon 3 ( Fig 3B ). Note that because of the primer design, transcripts with individually skipped exon 3 as well as transcripts with co-skipped exons 3, 5 and 7 will also be amplified in this QPCR. As per MESDA results, the levels of the latter transcripts were increased in PQ-treated animals ( Fig 2A ). Due to technical limitations, we were unable to validate the levels of specific transcripts (such as Δ3,7 and Δ3,5,7) by QPCR. We also used brain samples to quantify intron-retained products. Except for a reduced rate of retention of  SMN2  intron 1, our results of QPCR revealed no significant difference in intron retention between normal and PQ-treated samples ( S4 Fig ). Thus, enhanced skipping of exons, individual or multiple, appears to be the major consequence of OS for  SMN2  splicing.
Oxidative stress differentially affects splicing of various  SMN2  exons in reproductive organs
We also examined the relative abundance of various  SMN2  transcripts in mouse reproductive organs harvested at 24 h post PQ treatment. Consistent with previous reports in two different mouse models of SMA [ 32 , 52 ], we observed FL  SMN2  transcript as the major splice isoform in testis of untreated animals. Similar to a recent report employing a mild mouse model of SMA [ 32 ], testis of untreated TG mice showed noticeably higher levels of  SMN2  exon 5 skipping compared to other organs ( Fig 4 ). We also detected low levels of co-skipping of  SMN2  exons 5 and 6 ( Fig 4A ). Interestingly, PQ treatment did not produce significant changes in the splicing of any of the  SMN2  exons ( Fig 4A ). We observed only a small decrease in the levels of the FL transcripts ( Fig 4A ). The relative levels of various  SMN2  transcripts in uterus/ovary with or without PQ treatment were almost identical to those observed in brain or spinal cord (compare Figs  4A  and  2A ).
We also performed QPCR to determine the frequency of specific splicing events in PQ-treated reproductive organs. As a control we used brain from the same animal. Validating the results of MESDA ( Fig 4A ), we observed no appreciable change in the splicing pattern of any of the  SMN2  exons in testis of TG mice injected with PQ ( Fig 4B ). Similar to brain, enhanced skipping of  SMN2  exons 3, 5 and 7 were major events in uterus/ovary of TG mice treated with PQ ( Fig 4B ). Also, most of the OS-induced skipping of  SMN2  exon 5 in uterus/ovary occurred in transcripts that lacked exon 7.
Suboptimal splice sites contribute towards oxidative-stress-induced aberrant splicing of exons
To assess the potential contribution of cis-regulatory elements and splice sites to OS-induced aberrant splicing, we compared sequences of seven exons whose skipping was increased by OS ( Fig 5A and 5B ). We also analyzed their flanking intronic sequences. Except for  SMN2  exon 5 and 7, other exons were chosen randomly. The OS-induced changes in the splicing pattern of these exons were assessed by RT-PCR, using cDNAs from brain generated with oligo(dT) 12-18 . For the PCR step, we used primers that annealed to sequences of exons that flank an OS-sensitive exon of interest. Usually exons that are included have G residues at their first and last positions [ 53 , 54 ]. Underscoring the weak 3′ and/or 5′ ss as the possible contributor to exon skipping under the conditions of OS, five of the seven skipped exons lacked the preferred R (purine) and/or G residues at the first and/or the last positions of exons, respectively. Exceptions to this rule were exon 6 of  Tcerg1  and exon 18 of  Smarcc2 . The splice sites of these exons might be suboptimal due to other reasons. For instance, the presence of a U residue at the 5 th  position of  Tcerg1  intron 6 shortens the region base-paired with U1 snRNA, thus, hampering an efficient recruitment of the U1 snRNP to the 5′ ss of  Tcerg1  exon 6 ( Fig 5A ).
We also analyzed splice sites of five alternatively spliced exons that we found to be included in response to OS caused by PQ ( Fig 5A and 5B ). All of these candidate exons had a favorable R residue at the first exonic position. Four of these exons also had a favorable G residue at the last exonic position. Under normal conditions, three of the five exons were predominantly skipped ( Fig 5B ;  Plod2  exon 14,  Uspl1  exon 2 and  Atxn2  exon 10). All of these exons appear to have suboptimal 5′ ss due to poor base pairing between U1 snRNA and the 5′ ss ( Fig 5A ).
Several studies have implicated the role of RNA structure in regulation of  SMN2  exon 7 splicing [ 55 – 57 ]. In particular, we have demonstrated that the 5′ ss of  SMN  exon 7 is sequestered by a terminal stem-loop structure (TSL2), as well as by an internal stem formed by the long-distance interaction (ISTL1) [ 56 , 57 ]. We also analyzed the structural context of other eleven OS-sensitive exons described in  Fig 5A and 5B . For most exons, the predicted structure showed a strong terminal or internal stem encompassing the 5′ ss or its vicinity ( Fig 5C ). However, we did not observe any structure(s) specific for exon exclusion versus inclusion triggered by OS.
We then analyzed what motifs were enriched within these twelve exons and their flanking intronic sequences. Two hexameric motifs (MAYCAM and AKYMAR), a purine-rich motif (ARAGA) and a GC-rich motif (CTGKRY) were present respectively in seven, six and five exons skipped under OS ( S5A Fig ). In addition, two (AKWGST and ACAG) and four motifs (CCCT, GYRRGT, GCTTWC and WGWGRA) were enriched in upstream and downstream introns of most of these skipped exons ( S5A Fig ). At the same time, four motifs (ACWMRG, GBTCA, GWAR and CCAAVT) were enriched in at least four of the five exons that showed increased inclusion in response to OS ( S5B Fig ). In addition, two (MASAMA and TSCMTS) and three motifs (SCWC, CAWAM and ACTA) were present respectively in upstream and downstream introns of these exons ( S5B Fig ). The variety of the above-listed enriched motifs suggests involvement of multiple protein factors in splicing regulation of these exons under normal and OS conditions.
Effect of oxidative stress on levels of SMN protein and regulatory factors in TG brain
To interrogate the role of factors that affect splicing and post-splicing events of  SMN2  under the conditions of OS in vivo, we examined the levels of several proteins in TG brain within the first 24 h of PQ treatment. We began with the determination of SMN levels, since an OS-induced decline in SMN levels will have a direct impact on snRNP assembly and genome-wide perturbations of splicing. Both  Smn  and  SMN2  contribute to the overall SMN pool in TG mice. Hence, we used two different antibodies to distinguish human SMN (hSMN) from total SMN (hSMN + mSmn). Because of the overwhelming skipping of  SMN2  exons 5 and 7 induced by OS (Figs  2A ,  3B  and  4B ), we expected to see a decline in the levels of hSMN in brain of TG animals injected with PQ. We observed only a small but statistically significant reduction in hSMN in TG brain subjected to OS ( Fig 6 ). A small decline in hSMN did not significantly change the total levels of SMN in TG brain subjected to OS ( Fig 6 ). Of note, we confirmed that all  SMN  splice variants are capable of being translated when expressed ectopically in HeLa cells ( S6 Fig ). However, we did not detect any hSMN isoforms including those corresponding to  SMN2 ΔC7 and  SMN2 ΔC5,7 transcripts, the major splice isoforms observed under OS conditions. Skipping of  SMN2  exon 7 results in the generation of a protein degradation signal at the C-terminus of SMN [ 19 ]. Since skipping of exon 7 occurred in all prominent splice isoforms generated under OS, the degradation signal was the likely cause why we were unable to detect these proteins.
Gemin2 tightly interacts with SMN and contributes towards most (if not all) SMN-associated functions [ 20 ]. We did not observe a significant change in Gemin2, suggesting that the SMN-Gemin2 complex is not a limiting factor during the first 24 h of PQ-induced OS ( Fig 6 ). Eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4A2 is involved in microRNA-mediated translational repression [ 58 ]. PQ-induced OS did not alter eIF4A2 level ( Fig 6 ), suggesting that the general microRNA-mediated translation suppression is unlikely to be triggered during the initial stages of OS. Consistent with the insignificant change in the levels of serine/arginine (SR)-phosphorylating protein SRPK in TG brain subjected to OS, we did not observe a general change in the phosphorylation status of splicing factors ( Fig 6 ). Nonetheless, these results should be treated with caution because enhanced phosphorylation of one protein could be masked by dephosphorylation of another protein of similar size. Further, SF2/ASF, an SR protein, has been previously implicated in strengthening of the 3′ ss of  SMN  exon 7 [ 59 ]. The strength of a 3′ ss could also be altered by hnRNP K, a critical splicing factor with important role in neuronal differentiation [ 60 ]. However, we did not observe any significant OS-induced changes in levels of these proteins in TG brain ( Fig 6 ).
Splicing factors hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2 are known negative regulators of  SMN2  exon 7 splicing [ 61 , 62 ]. These two proteins interact with both exon 7 and intron 7 of  SMN2  [ 63 ]. While levels of hnRNP A1 in TG brain subjected to OS remained unaffected, we observed a small but statistically significant decrease in the level of hnRNP A2 ( Fig 6 ). These results suggest that the rules of exon skipping under conditions of OS might be governed by factors that are not necessarily negative regulators. Indeed, we observed a small but noticeable decrease in the level of TIA1, a glutamine-rich protein that serves as a key regulator of stress granule formation. We have previously reported TIA1 as a positive regulator of  SMN2  exon 7 splicing [ 45 ]. Similar to TIA1, PSF is another glutamine-rich protein that stimulates  SMN2  exon 7 inclusion. Based on sequence homology, PSF is grouped along with p54nrb/NONO proteins [ 64 ]. However, unlike TIA1, we did not find a statistically significant change in the levels of PSF and p54nrb proteins in TG brain upon PQ treatment ( Fig 6 ). Level of another splicing factor, SRp55, that is known to interact with the 5′ ss of an exon [ 65 ], showed a noticeable but statistically insignificant increase in PQ-treated brain ( Fig 6 ).
Proteome analysis reveals a role for hnRNP H in OS-induced downregulation of SMN
To capture novel regulatory factors that are likely to affect level of SMN under OS conditions, we employed a two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoreses of lysates prepared from TG brains harvested at 24 h post PQ treatment. We performed two independent experiments to ensure the reproducibility of our findings. After comparing the results of 2D gel electrophoresis, we investigated four protein spots that were significantly altered in brains subjected to OS ( Fig 7A ). We analyzed these proteins by mass spectrometry using MALDI-TOF and LC/MS ( S2 Table ). These proteins were identified as lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), alpha-enolase 1 (ENO1) and hnRNP H. While LDHB and PGAM1 were found to be upregulated, ENO1 and hnRNP H were found to be downregulated ( Fig 7B ). To determine whether the altered expression of the above proteins was due to changes in transcription, we performed QPCR. Consistent with the OS-induced downregulation of ENO1 and hnRNP H proteins, we observed a small but statistically significant decrease in their transcripts ( Fig 7C ). However, we did not capture a significant change in  Ldhb  and  Pgam1  transcripts in PQ-treated brain, suggesting that posttranslational modification(s) cause differential expression of LDHB and PGAM1 ( Fig 7C ). Considering that ENO1, LDHB and PGAM1 are involved in glycolysis and/or gluconeogesis pathways, their alteration during OS was not surprising. In particular, downregulation of ENO1 in striatum of PQ-treated mice mimicking Parkinson’s disease has been previously reported [ 66 ].
A recent study precluded the role of hnRNP H in  SMN  exon 7 splicing, since the depletion of this protein did not affect splicing of exon 7 [ 67 ]. However, the effect of hnRNP H has not been tested in splicing of other  SMN  exons. Moreover, the conditions of OS could cause post-translational modifications in hnRNP H. Such modified hnRNP H can then affect splicing of  SMN2  exons. Having detected the OS-induced downregulation of hnRNP H in our proteome analysis, we performed Western blot to determine whether the conditions of OS cause a general decline in expression of hnRNP H. We did not capture a statistically significant decrease in the level of hnRNP H in brain of TG mice treated with PQ ( Fig 7D ). These results suggest that the change in the level of hnRNP H captured in proteome analysis is likely due to post-translational modification(s). To independently validate these findings in the context of a human cell line, we performed experiments in SH-SY5Y cells as previously described [ 41 ]. Similar to the results obtained in TG brain, we observed no significant decrease in the level of hnRNP H in SH-SY5Y cells treated with PQ ( S7 Fig ). We also performed similar experiment in SMA patient fibroblasts (GM03813 cells) and observed no significant change in the level of hnRNP H in PQ-treated fibroblasts ( S7 Fig ).
