Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in increasing the transcript diversity from a single gene [ 1 ]. All human genes with two or more exons are alternatively spliced in one or more tissues at one or more stages of development or distress [ 2 ]. Alternative splicing confers immense variability to the functional RNA motifs (sequence and structural) with implications to RNA-protein interactions that regulate and facilitate post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, including RNA stability, RNA trafficking, mRNA translation, protein trapping and chromatin remodeling. Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex and dynamic machinery, comprised of hundreds of proteins that are differently assembled at different introns [ 3 , 4 ]. To add further complexity to the process, splicing is coupled with transcription, 5′-end capping and 3′-end polyadenylation of RNA [ 5 ]. A combinatorial control by cis-regulatory elements, RNA structure and transacting factors governs alternative splicing [ 6 – 9 ]. Mutations within regulatory sequences cause defective splicing and result in genetic diseases [ 10 – 12 ]. Genotoxic and oxidative stress (OS) conditions can also trigger aberrant splicing [ 13 – 15 ]. However, the mechanism of OS-induced aberrant splicing remains poorly understood.
Humans have two nearly identical  Survival Motor Neuron  ( SMN ) genes;  SMN1  and  SMN2  [ 16 ]. A full-length (FL) transcript and FL SMN protein are the major products of the  SMN1  gene, whereas the  SMN2  gene predominantly generates a truncated transcript and a truncated protein (SMNΔ7) due to skipping of exon 7 [ 17 ]. Unlike SMN, SMNΔ7 is only partially functional and highly unstable [ 18 , 19 ]. SMN plays a role in a variety of cellular processes, including transcription, snRNP biogenesis, DNA recombination, stress granule formation, vesicular transport, signal transduction, and motor neuron trafficking [ 20 ]. Deletion of and/or mutations in  SMN1  coupled with the inability of  SMN2  to compensate for the loss of  SMN1  leads to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a leading genetic disease of children and infants [ 21 – 23 ]. Mice contain a single  Smn  gene, which is equivalent to  SMN1 . Consistent with the indispensable nature of SMN, deletion of  Smn  gene leads to embryonic lethality [ 24 ]. However, introduction of  SMN2  into the null  Smn -/-  background recapitulates a SMA phenotype [ 25 ]. While the role of  SMN2  remains elusive, it serves as a promising target for SMA therapy by compounds that elevate the levels of SMN by enhancing  SMN2  transcription and/or by correcting  SMN2  exon 7 splicing [ 20 – 22 , 26 , 27 ]. Since  SMN2  contributes towards the overall cellular pool of SMN, its copy number impacts the severity of SMA [ 25 , 28 ]. Evidence is emerging that SMN serves as a disease-modifying factor in other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 29 – 31 ]. A recent study suggests a high level of SMN is required for the testicular development and male fertility [ 32 ].
OS is linked to several chronic conditions including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases [ 33 ]. Paraquat (PQ, 1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride) is an environmental toxin and OS stimulant that is widely implicated in reactive oxygen species formation and mitochondrial dysfunctions [ 34 – 36 ]. PQ is commonly used in cell- and animal-based models to study the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease as well as to uncover the mechanism by which OS impacts various cellular processes [ 37 – 39 ]. However, the mechanism by which PQ causes splicing defects is poorly understood. A previous study has shown increased skipping of  SMN2  exons 5 and 7 in neuronal cells treated with PQ [ 40 ]. Employing a multi-exon-skipping detection assay (MESDA), we have recently demonstrated that splicing of multiple exons of  SMN1  and  SMN2  are affected by PQ-induced OS in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells [ 41 ]. Findings of these studies provide a clue that various  SMN  exons may be differently affected in different tissues subjected to PQ-induced OS. However, there is no in vivo study on how PQ affects tissue-specific splicing of various exons of  SMN  or any other gene harboring multiple skipping exons.
Here we examine the body-wide impact of PQ-induced OS on splicing of various  SMN2  exons in a healthy transgenic mouse model carrying the  SMN2  transgene. Our MESDA results reveal tissue-specific signatures of  SMN2  splice isoforms generated by OS. We analyzed cis-elements and transacting factors to uncover likely mechanisms by which splicing of various exons are impacted by OS.
