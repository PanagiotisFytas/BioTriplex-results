Ispinesib is a substrate for the P-gp and Bcrp efflux transporters
Ispinesib was administered intravenously to Friend leukemia virus strain B (FVB) wild-type mice and to FVB mice deleted for the P-gp and Bcrp efflux transporters (referred to as  Mdr1a/b −/− 
 Bcrp1 −/− ) in order to determine how these efflux transporters affect brain distribution. The plasma and brain concentration  versus  time profiles and brain-to-plasma ratios following a single intravenous (iv) bolus dose of 5 mg/kg ispinesib are depicted in Fig.  1A–C . At each time point, the brain concentrations are significantly lower than the corresponding plasma concentrations in wild-type mice, while in  Mdr1a/b −/− 
 Bcrp1 −/−  mice, they are significantly higher. A summary of the pharmacokinetic parameters is presented in Fig.  1D . The brain-to-plasma AUC ratios (K p ,  Equation 3 , Supplementary methods) for ispinesib in wild-type and  Mdr1a/b −/− 
 Bcrp1 −/−  mice are 0.23 and 12.12, respectively. We further measured free and bound drug in plasma and in brain using rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) technique. These experiments reveal that ispinesib exhibits a high degree of binding to proteins and cellular constituents. The percentages of unbound drug ( Equations 1 and 2 , Supplementary methods) in plasma and brain are 0.6 ± 0.1% and 0.05 ± 0.02%, respectively. We used the unbound fractions to calculate the unbound concentrations and unbound partition coefficients (K p,uu ) of ispinesib ( Equation 6 , Supplementary methods). The K p,uu  are 0.02 and 1.01 in wild-type and  Mdr1a/b −/− 
 Bcrp1 −/−  mice, respectively. Figure 1 Mdr1a/b −/− 
 Bcrp1 −/−  mice following intravenous bolus dose of 5 mg/kg are shown: ( A ) Plasma concentrations, ( B ) brain concentrations, and ( C ) brain-to-plasma concentration ratios. The pharmacokinetic parameters estimated using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) are listed in the table ( D ). Data represent mean ± S.D., n = 4. The AUCs in the table represent mean ± S.E.M. Abbreviations: AUC (0-t) , area under the curve from zero to the time of last measured concentration; CL, clearance; V d , volume of distribution; K p , the ratio of AUC (0-t,brain)  to AUC (0-t,plasma)  using total drug concentrations; K p,uu , the ratio of AUC (0-t,brain)  to AUC (0-t,plasma)  using unbound drug concentrations; DA (Distribution Advantage), the ratio of K p,knockout  to K p,wild-type . Brain accumulation of ispinesib is limited by active efflux at the BBB. The pharmacokinetic profiles of ispinesib in wild-type and 
These results demonstrate that ispinesib crosses the BBB but is a substrate for one or both of the P-gp and Bcrp efflux transporters. In order to determine which of these drives ispinesib efflux, we measured ispinesib plasma and brain concentrations, and brain-to-plasma concentration ratios in FVB mice with the following genotypes: wild type,  Mdr1a/b −/−  (deleted for only P-gp ), Bcrp1 −/−  (deleted for only Bcrp), and  Mdr1a/b −/− 
 Bcrp1 −/−  (deleted for both) at 2 and 6 hours following intraperitoneal (ip) administration of 10 mg/kg ispinesib. The results are depicted in Fig.  2  and Supplementary Table  S1 . The plasma concentrations (Fig.  2A ) are similar in the four genotypes of mice. However, brain concentrations (Fig.  2B ) are significantly higher in  Mdr1a/b −/− 
 Bcrp1 −/−  mice compared to wild-type mice. The brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (Fig.  2C ) 2 hours after drug administration for wild-type,  Bcrp1 −/− ,  Mdr1a/b −/−  and  Mdr1a/b −/− 
 Bcrp1 −/−  mice are 0.11, 0.08, 0.35 and 3.07, respectively, while at 6 hours, they are 0.16, 0.15, 1.52 and 5.20, respectively. These results indicate that P-gp and Bcrp play a cooperative role in restricting the brain uptake of ispinesib. We conclude that effective blocking of active efflux of ispinesib at the BBB requires targeting both of these transport proteins. Figure 2 A ), brain concentrations ( B ), and brain-to-plasma concentration ratios ( C ) at 2 and 6 hours following administration of a single intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg ispinesib to FVB wild-type,  Bcrp1 −/− ,  Mdr1a/b −/−  and  Mdr1a/b −/−

Elacridar significantly enhances ispinesib concentrations in brain and in orthotopic GBM
We injected FVB wild-type mice with a single ip dose of 10 mg/kg ispinesib or 10 mg/kg ispinesib simultaneously with 10 mg/kg elacridar, a highly potent and specific inhibitor of P-gp (EC 50  of 20–200 nM 25 , 26 ) and Bcrp (EC 50  of about 300 nM 27 ), and measured ispinesib concentrations in brain and plasma 2 and 6 hours later. The results are summarized in Fig.  3  and Supplementary Table  S2 . While the concentration of ispinesib in plasma (Fig.  3A ) is unaffected by elacridar at both the time points, the brain concentrations (Fig.  3B ) are higher and the brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (Fig.  3C )  are approximately 10-fold higher with elacridar co-administration. Figure 3 A ), brain concentrations ( B ), and brain-to-plasma concentration ratios ( C ) of ispinesib at 2 and 6 hours post dose following a single intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg/kg ispinesib in FVB wild-type mice with or without 10 mg/kg elacridar co-dosing are illustrated. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 for statistical comparison by unpaired t-test. Data represent mean ± S.D., n = 4. Inhibition of P-gp and Bcrp by elacridar co-administration improves the brain distribution of ispinesib. The plasma concentrations (
We wished to determine how systemically administered ispinesib is distributed within the brain of an orthotopic GBM rodent model, and to evaluate if elacridar co-administration alters this distribution. We generated fluorescent GBMs in 3-day old rat pups by intracerebral injection of a retrovirus encoding for PDGF and TdTomato 28 , 29 . After an additional 21 days, rat pups were injected ip with a single dose of microemulsion vehicle, 10 mg/kg elacridar, 10 mg/kg ispinesib, or a combination of 10 mg/kg ispinesib and 10 mg/kg elacridar, and they were sacrificed 2 hours later. We employed a fluorescence-guided punching technique (Supplementary Fig.  S2 ) to isolate tumor core, tumor rim (tumor-infiltrated brain), and normal (tumor-free) brain (Fig.  4A,B  and Supplementary Fig.  S3 ), measured the concentrations of ispinesib in these samples and in plasma (Fig.  4C ), and calculated the corresponding tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios (Fig.  4D ). The results show that there is a heterogeneous distribution of ispinesib, with higher drug concentrations in the tumor core compared to the surrounding brain. Furthermore, the uptake/retention of ispinesib is relatively restricted from the invasive tumor rim compared to the tumor core. This trend is similar in both the ispinesib and ispinesib+elacridar treatment groups. However, there is an approximately 10-fold increase in the K p  in the tumor rim and normal brain regions and a 4-fold increase in K p  in the tumor core when elacridar is co-administered with ispinesib (Fig.  4E ). These observations indicate that elacridar co-administration improves the distribution of ispinesib in this orthotopic GBM model, particularly to the invasive edge of the tumor. Figure 4 A ), and the dissected tissues ( B ) are depicted. The bar graphs represent the concentrations ( C ) and brain(tumor)-to-plasma concentration ratios ( D ) in plasma, regions of tumor and normal brain. The table presents the concentrations, brain(tumor)-to-plasma concentration ratios (K p ), and fold increase in K p  in different regions ( E ). Ispinesib concentrations are significantly higher in ispinesib and elacridar co-dosed group compared to ispinesib group for normal brain (p < 0.05), tumor rim (p < 0.01), and tumor core (p < 0.01). The brain(tumor)-to-plasma ratios of ispinesib are significantly higher in ispinesib and elacridar co-dosed group compared to ispinesib group for normal brain (p < 0.001), tumor rim (p < 0.01), and tumor core (p < 0.01). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 for statistical comparison by one-way ANOVA. Data represent mean ± S.D. Abbreviations: K p brain , the ratio of C brain  to C plasma 1 , fold increase in K p  over the K p  in normal brain of ispinesib treated group. Uptake of ispinesib to regions of intracranial GBM is heterogeneous and is significantly enhanced upon elacridar co-administration. Rats bearing GBM tumors were randomized to receive a single intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg ispinesib with or without simultaneous co-dosing of 10 mg/kg elacridar (n = 9). The blood and brain (tumor-bearing) samples were collected 2 hours post dose, and a fluorescent-guided punching method was employed for isolation of brain regions of interest.

Ispinesib is active against both human and murine GBM cell lines
We measured the efficacy of ispinesib  in vitro  against three GBM cell lines: GBM1A, TP53(−/−), and PTEN(−/−). GBM1A is a human GBM line that has glioma TIC features 30 . TP53(−/−), and PTEN(−/−) are PDGF-driven murine GBM cell lines 31 . Treatment with ispinesib resulted in potent tumor cell killing in all the tested GBM cell lines. The EC 50 s from ispinesib dose-response curves in GBM1A (Fig.  5A ,  solid blue line with closed circles ), TP53(−/−) (Fig.  5A ,  solid red line with closed triangles ), and PTEN(−/−) (Fig.  5A ,  green line with closed squares ) are 1.4 ± 0.2, 14.4 ± 1.2 and 10 ± 0.9 nM, respectively. In addition to being active components of the BBB, both P-gp and Bcrp efflux transporters are frequently expressed in TICs, such as GBM1A 32 – 34 . We wondered if these two proteins might play a substantial role in modulating intrinsic responsiveness to ispinesib, so we measured ispinesib dose-response relationship of GBM1A cells in the presence of 500 nM elacridar. As Fig.  5A  shows, elacridar has at most a modest effect, shifting the EC 50  of ispinesib for GBM1A ( dashed blue line with open circles ), TP53(−/−) ( dashed red line with open triangles ), and PTEN(−/−) ( dashed green line with open squares ) cells to 0.5 ± 0.04, 3.9 ± 0.5, and 3.3 ± 0.4 nM, respectively. Figure 5 in vitro  EC 50  can be achieved by evading efflux transport. ( A ) The responses of human GBM1A, murine TP53(−/−), and murine PTEN(−/−) glioma cell lines to ispinesib alone  (solid lines with closed symbols)  or the combination of ispinesib and elacridar ( dashed lines with open symbols)  are depicted. Data represent mean ± S.D., n = 3 biological replicates. The dose-response data were fit to the Hill equation, and the determined EC 50 s and Hill coefficients are listed in the table. ( B ) The predicted unbound concentration-time profiles of ispinesib in plasma ( solid blue curve ) and brain of FVB wild-type mice following 5 mg/kg intravenous drug administration are depicted. The unbound concentration profiles in brain of wild-type mice ( solid red curve ), with a 10-fold increase in brain concentrations as with elacridar co-administration ( dotted orange curve ), and with a 50-fold increase in brain concentrations as in P-gp and Bcrp deficient mice ( dotted pink curve ) are shown. The unbound concentrations were determined using the  in vivo  concentrations of ispinesib (shown in Fig.  1 ) and the estimates of unbound fraction (fu) from  in vitro  rapid equilibrium dialysis experiments. The  dashed green line  indicates the experimentally determined  in vitro  EC 50  in human GBM1A cell line. Data represent mean ± S.D., n = 4. Human and murine glioma cells are sensitive to ispinesib, and unbound concentrations in brain higher than 
Subsequently, we wanted to test the efficacy of combining ispinesib with elacridar in an  in vivo  rodent model of GBM. Before performing these studies, however, we compared the predicted unbound concentration-time profiles of ispinesib following 5 mg/kg intravenous administration in FVB wild-type mice with the  in vitro  EC 50  of ispinesib against GBM1A (Fig.  5B ). The comparisons show that the unbound concentrations in the brain ( solid red curve ) are appreciably below the EC 50  ( dashed green line ) for this drug. Increasing the brain concentrations of ispinesib by 10-fold ( dotted orange curve ), such as would occur with elacridar co-administration, would result in unbound concentrations higher than EC 50 , and thereby allow the brain to be exposed to a therapeutic concentration of the drug for a substantial fraction of time. Increasing the unbound concentration by 50-fold in brain ( dotted pink curve ), such as would occur in P-gp and Bcrp deficient mice, would result in unbound brain concentrations matching the plasma concentrations ( solid blue curve ) and would enhance the time of therapeutic drug exposure substantially further.
Elacridar significantly improves the efficacy of ispinesib in blocking mitosis in GBM
KIF11 inhibition induces bipolar mitotic spindle to collapse into a monopolar structure, and this histologic hallmark can be used as a surrogate marker for the anti-mitotic effect of ispinesib 7 . We therefore examined if we could enhance this effect by systemically co-administering ispinesib and elacridar to rodents with intracranial GBM. We accomplished this by intraperitoneally injecting a single dose of vehicle, 10 mg/kg elacridar, 10 mg/kg ispinesib, or a combination of 10 mg/kg ispinesib and 10 mg/kg elacridar into NSG mice with orthotopic GBM1A tumors, sacrificing animals after 8 hours, excising brains, and staining sections through the core of the tumor for tubulin and DNA. We counted the number of cells with monopolar spindles in each of these four conditions to determine the fraction of cells with monopoles (Fig.  6A ). The insets in the vehicle and elacridar treated brains show the normal distribution of DNA ( blue ) in the center, surrounded by tubulin ( red ) in the periphery. By contrast, ispinesib administration produces occasional monopoles, with DNA-containing chromosomes in the periphery surrounding a center of tubulin ( white arrows ). Co-administration of elacridar with ispinesib markedly increased the fraction of monopoles. This is quantified in Fig.  6B , which demonstrates that elacridar significantly enhances the ability of ispinesib to produce the desired pharmacodynamic effect. Figure 6 A ) Mice with orthotopic GBM were injected with a single intraperitoneal dose of vehicle, 10 mg/kg elacridar, 10 mg/kg ispinesib, or a combination of 10 mg/kg ispinesib and 10 mg/kg elacridar (n = 8–10). At 8 hours, whole brains were collected, stained for tubulin and counter stained for DAPI. The insets in vehicle and elacridar treated groups show bipolar spindle formed during normal mitotic division, DNA ( blue ) in the center surrounded by tubulin ( red ) in periphery. The insets in ispinesib and combination (ispinesib+elacridar treated) groups show collapsed monopolar spindle in a fraction of cells, with tubulin in the center surrounded by DNA-containing chromosomes in periphery. The monopoles are marked with  white arrows . ( B ) DAPI stained cells and monopolar spindle positive cells were counted, and percent monopolar spindles are depicted. Statistical testing using two tailed t-test. Data represent mean ± S.D., n = 3 biological replicates. ( C ) NSG mice were intracranially injected with luciferase expressing human GBM1A cells. After 7 days, animals were randomized to receive intraperitoneal doses of vehicle, 10 mg/kg elacridar, 10 mg/kg ispinesib, or 10 mg/kg ispinesib and 10 mg/kg elacridar (n = 10) once every 4 days for 28 days ( Treatment ). Tumor growth was monitored by measuring bioluminescence signal, and photon flux was plotted against time. ( D ) The data in ( C ) during treatment period is depicted in an expanded scale. Photon flux for this time period could be fit to a set of single exponential growth equations, revealing doubling times of 7.9 (vehicle), 6.2 (elacridar), 9.4 (ispinesib) and 35.9 (ispinesib+elacridar) days. (E) Kaplan-Meier survival curves that define median survival of 61, 62, 74, and 92 days for vehicle, elacridar, ispinesib, and elacridar+ispinesib treatment, respectively. While differences between vehicle and elacridar do not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07, log rank test), those between vehicle/elacridar and ispinesib, as well as between vehicle/elacridar and ispinesib+elacridar are significant (p < 0.001, log rank test). Likewise, difference in survival between ispinesib and ispinesib+elacridar also reaches statistical significance (p < 0.0001, log rank test). Elacridar co-administration significantly enhances anti-mitotic activity and efficacy of ispinesib in an orthotopic mouse model of GBM. (
Elacridar significantly enhances the efficacy of systemically administered ispinesib in a rodent model of GBM
We injected 500,000 luciferase expressing GBM1A cells into the white matter of NSG recipient mice and initiated treatment 7 days later with vehicle, 10 mg/kg ip elacridar, 10 mg/kg ip ispinesib, or a combination of 10 mg/kg ispinesib and 10 mg/kg elacridar ip, once every 4 days for a total of 28 days. We monitored the increase in bioluminescence (BLI) signal to assess the kinetics of tumor growth and followed animals for survival, and results are depicted in Fig.  6C–E . Figure  6C  depicts photon flux  versus  time during the course of the experiment, with the period of drug treatment ( days 7–37 post tumor inoculation ) indicated. Figure  6D  illustrates a plot of BLI over days 7–37, with data fit to single exponential growth equations. This reveals tumor doubling times of 7.9 (vehicle), 6.2 (elacridar), 9.4 (ispinesib) and 35.9 (ispinesib + elacridar) days. The mice in this experiment were also followed for survival after discontinuing treatment on day 37, and Kaplan Meier survival curves are illustrated in Fig.  6E . The median survival for vehicle, elacridar, ispinesib, and elacridar+ispinesib treated groups are 61, 62, 74, and 92 days, respectively. While treatment with ispinesib alone prolongs survival compared to vehicle or elacridar (p < 0.0001, log rank test), combined therapy with elacridar and ispinesib is clearly superior to ispinesib alone (p < 0.0001, log rank test). These results demonstrate a significant improvement in efficacy when elacridar was co-dosed to enhance the brain accumulation of ispinesib. Also, the combination of ispinesib and elacridar in the above dosing regimen was well tolerated without any toxicity related death events.
