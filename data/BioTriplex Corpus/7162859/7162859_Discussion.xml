Tumor heterogeneity has been a defining feature for GBM since the early histopathology studies of the 19 th  century 35 . More recently, this heterogeneity has been documented to occur at the genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression levels, both from one GBM tumor to another, as well as within a given GBM 36 – 38 . However, heterogeneity also occurs at the level of cell biology, as GBM cells have also been observed to demonstrate two distinct phenotypes—one characterized by high proliferation and the other by high dispersion. Furthermore, we and others have shown that these two phenotypes are reciprocally related— inhibiting one activates the other 7 , 39 . Thus, an ideal GBM therapeutic needs to inhibit a target that drives both phenotypes simultaneously and be active against TICs and nonTICs alike. Our prior study 7  has shown that ispinesib addresses these requirements. However, to be clinically effective, ispinesib must also cross the BBB and be retained at sustained therapeutic concentrations within both tumor and surrounding brain. Our previous studies with other anti-cancer agents that are active against GBM  in vitro  and in  in vivo  flank models have shown that restricted brain delivery can render these promising compounds ineffective in orthotopic GBM 40 – 42 . A key contributor to this problem is P-gp and Bcrp-mediated active efflux at the BBB. In this study, we have examined whether we can realize the potential of a promising GBM therapeutic, ispinesib, by improving its delivery to and retention within both brain and tumor.
The tightly regulated structure of the BBB is known to limit the delivery of a wide range of CNS therapeutics to the brain. For this reason, we sought to examine the brain distribution of ispinesib in FVB mice. The results shown in Fig.  1  suggest severely restricted delivery of ispinesib to the brain, as reflected from the brain-to-plasma partition coefficient (K p ) of 0.23 and unbound partition coefficient (K p,uu ) of 0.02 in wild-type mice. A major factor responsible for restricting the brain delivery of therapies is the gatekeeper function of the P-gp and Bcrp efflux transporters at the BBB 19 , 20 . We therefore performed additional studies in transporter-deleted mice to examine the influence of P-gp and Bcrp on the brain delivery of ispinesib. The K p  and K p,uu  in P-gp and Bcrp deficient mice were 12.12 and 1.01, respectively, which are substantially higher than the corresponding values in wild-type mice (Fig.  1 ). These results demonstrate that P-gp and Bcrp-mediated drug efflux plays a significant role in limiting the brain accumulation of ispinesib (Fig.  2 ). Together, the brain distribution studies in FVB mice show that ispinesib has poor brain retention due to active efflux by P-gp and Bcrp transport systems at the BBB.
Our results with elacridar, a potent non-toxic inhibitor of P-gp and Bcrp, highlight the importance of inhibiting efflux transport in order to improve brain delivery of promising therapeutics. Our results demonstrate a 10-fold enhancement in the brain delivery of ispinesb (Fig.  3 ) with co-administration of elacridar implying that targeting drug efflux transport at the BBB enhances the brain accumulation of ispinesib. There have been reports of spatial heterogeneity in drug uptake to brain tumors, with severely limited drug accumulation in certain tumor regions residing behind an intact BBB 23 , 24 , 43 . Such restricted delivery can result in the establishment of a protected pharmacological sanctuary for the tumors that can therefore grow unimpeded within the CNS. We therefore measured the regional drug distribution in a preclinical model of GBM, and also evaluated if ispinesib accumulation in the regions of tumor with an intact BBB can be improved with elacridar co-administration. The results depicted in Fig.  4  reveal regional variability in ispinesib delivery with higher accumulation in the tumor core, where the BBB is relatively compromised, and with lower accumulation in the invasive tumor rim, where the BBB is more often intact. This confirms that systemic delivery of ispinesib to treat GBM would likely lead to early disease relapse, due to inadequate drug concentrations at the tumor/brain interface. We therefore tested the impact of elacridar co-administration on the delivery of ispinesib to regions of GBM. Our observations, depicted in Fig.  4 , show that there is an improvement in the delivery of ispinesib to the tumor, not only in regions where the BBB is already defective, but in the invasive margin of the tumor as well.
Our brain distribution studies prompted us to explore if we could translate this enhanced delivery to improved efficacy in mice with orthotopic GBMs. We began by comparing the  in vitro  cytotoxic concentrations of ispinesib in a GBM cell line (Fig.  5A ) with the unbound brain concentration-time profile in wild-type mice. This reveals that the free concentration of ispinesib in the brain following an intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg is lower than the  in vitro  EC 50  in GBM1A ( solid red curve , Fig.  5B ). However, our results predict that co-administration of elacridar should appreciably enhance the fraction of time that brain and GBM are exposed to therapeutic drug concentrations ( dotted orange curve , Fig.  5B ), which in turn would enhance the probability that sufficient drug would be present to kill cells when they are vulnerable, in M phase. This prompted us to examine the effect of elacridar co-administration on monopolar spindle formation (Fig.  6A,B ),  in vivo  tumor growth kinetics, and survival (Fig.  6C–E ) in an orthotopic GBM1A mouse model. We find that elacridar co-administration markedly increases the frequency of monopolar spindles—a surrogate marker for anti-mitotic activity of ispinesib  in situ . Our  in vivo  efficacy studies build on this finding by demonstrating that while ispinesib by itself slows tumor growth and improves survival in an  in vivo  GBM model, these effects can be markedly enhanced by co-administration of elacridar. These outcomes show that improving the brain accumulation of ispinesib results in superior  in vivo  target engagement and efficacy in an orthotopic model of GBM.
While the BBB passively prevents the entry of hydrophilic drugs into the CNS, it is also capable of actively extruding hydrophobic small molecules, primarily through the action of two ABC transporters, P-gp and Bcrp 19 , 20 . Together, these features of the BBB present a major obstacle to the development of effective therapies for GBM. Although the BBB is heterogeneously compromised within a GBM, viable tumor cells are found in the brain-infiltrative margin where the BBB is intact, and this feature provides a therapeutic sanctuary that drives the inevitable recurrence of disease 24 . This highlights the general principle that efforts to identify new GBM targets and develop new drugs against such targets are in vain if they cannot be translated into therapies that reach and remain at the site of tumor growth and invasion. While the ability of the BBB to shield GBM from potentially effective therapeutics applies to any drug, it is particularly problematic for therapeutics that are only active during distinct phases of the cell cycle. Inhibitors of the mitotic kinesin KIF11 illustrate this point. The motivation for developing these inhibitors was the presumption that they would be devoid of the neurotoxicity seen with microtubule-directed anti-mitotics, and the clinical experience with these drugs has confirmed this 14 – 17 . However, KIF11 inhibitors are effective only when they are present in therapeutic concentrations during M phase, which accounts for only about 5% of cell cycle time 10 . Thus, for a KIF11 inhibitor to be therapeutically active in GBM, it needs not only to cross the BBB, but be retained within both brain and tumor at effective concentrations for considerable periods of time in order to target a substantial proportion of tumor cells when they are vulnerable.
Although we had previously shown that the KIF11 inhibitor ispinesib is capable of crossing the BBB and prolonging survival in a patient-derived xenograft model of GBM, we suspected that active extrusion of this hydrophobic therapeutic might limit its ability to control this disease 7 . Our current study confirms this suspicion. Ispinesib is indeed a substrate for P-gp and Bcrp transporters, which together reduce drug exposure  in situ  to sub-therapeutic concentrations. We have gone on to demonstrate that co-administration of elacridar, a potent and specific third generation inhibitor of both efflux transporters 25 , 27  can significantly enhance: i) brain concentrations of ispinesib, ii) the frequency of monopolar spindles—a surrogate marker for KIF11 inhibition; and iii) survival over ispinesib alone in an orthotopic xenograft model implanted with human GBM. Our results highlight the importance of blocking drug efflux transporters in GBM when sustained concentrations of drug are needed for a therapeutic effect. Although safety concerns have limited the clinical testing of efflux transport inhibitors 44 , 45 , we find that the combination of ispinesib and elacridar is well tolerated and does not lead to any toxicity related deaths. In addition, elacridar has been safely administered to patients in recent studies, and the development of an oral formulation of elacridar has revived interest in testing this compound in the clinic 46 , 47 . In short, our findings indicate that a GBM therapeutic which targets both of the malignant phenotypes of this disease—brain invasion and proliferation—can be made much more effective by simultaneously targeting the BBB efflux transporters in a manner that does not enhance drug toxicity. We believe that our approach in this study is applicable to a wide variety of other GBM therapies, and should be considered in designing both pre-clinical as well as clinical trials of promising drugs for the treatment of GBM.
