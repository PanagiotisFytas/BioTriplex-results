Our single-center retrospective study characterizes the outcomes of COVID-19 disease in relation to the stage of disease by serology. Since there are no current recommendations for COVID-19 serology use, this study can help to correlate mortality with early and late disease [ 5 , 15 ]. Antibody-based serologic tests measure the person’s humoral immune response, unlike NAAT, which detects viral RNA. Therefore, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies typically become detectable more than two weeks after infection, which correlates with a viral replication phase of the disease [ 5 , 12 , 16 - 17 ].
IgM antibodies are used as a measure of recent infection since they are directed against microorganisms that are produced first after infection. IgG antibodies generally develop later after IgM and remain elevated for months to years after infection. Although IgM antibodies can be seen within the first two weeks of symptoms in some patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection is unique in that IgM and IgG more commonly rise together, more than two weeks after the onset of symptoms [ 18 ]. Liu et al. were able to observe that the IgM antibody peaked and was detected earlier on than the IgG antibody and that severe cases of COVID-19 had a more robust response in relation to IgG and IgM antibodies [ 13 ]. In our study, the IgM positive did show a clinical significance for increased mortality when compared with the other two groups.
Most therapeutic clinical trials for COVID-19 use oxygen saturation and time of symptoms onset for inclusion criteria as seen in the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) and SOLIDARITY trial. We believe that those two parameters may not always correlate with the different stages of the disease [ 19 - 20 ]. COVID-19 has been described as a viremic replication phase and an inflammatory phase. While in the early inflammatory phase, pulmonary involvement is evident, causing hypoxemia, which may require respiratory support [ 21 - 22 ]. During this phase, a cytokine storm occurs, which allows steroids to be beneficial in this stage and not earlier [ 23 - 25 ]. It has also been noted that the inflammatory markers, D-dimers, and other cytokines rise as well [ 26 - 27 ], like our study.
In our study, it showed that LDH and ferritin were statistically significant in the IgM+ and IgM-/IgG+ subgroups (p-value 0.0061 and p-value 0.0013, respectively). This demonstrated that LDH and ferritin are good inflammatory markers in the subacute and late stages of the disease process of COVID-19. However, CRP and D-dimer were statistically significant in the IgM-/IgG- and IgM+ subgroups (P <0.0001 and p-value of 0.0452, respectively), which shows that CRP and D-dimer are better inflammatory markers for acute and subacute disease. Overall, the elevation of all four inflammatory markers mentioned was seen in the IgM+ subgroup, which correlates with the present stage of the COVID-19 disease. Along with an increase in inflammatory markers, it was determined that IgM+ carried the worst prognosis, with high mortality despite receiving remdesivir and dexamethasone like in many instances [ 24 , 28 - 30 ]. This proves that clinical trials should be specifically addressing this group, and without serology, specifically IgM, it will be difficult to recognize those patients at high risk of a bad outcome.
The study has few limitations. First, this study was a single-center retrospective study. Second, the smaller sample size in individuals with serology. Due to the serology not being a recommendation, it was not used in the study center early on, therefore causing the sample size to be smaller, which may affect the power of the study. All future clinical trials should include multiple centers and be prospective studies to overcome these limitations.
