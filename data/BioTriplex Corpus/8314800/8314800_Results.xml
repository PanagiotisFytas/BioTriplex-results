A total of 252 patients admitted to the hospital for suspected COVID-19 between October 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021, had SARS-CoV-2 serology available. Patients with no clear clinical outcomes and negative serologies with negative PCR and antigen were excluded. A total of 202 patients met the inclusion criteria and were selected for the study. Duplicates were also excluded.
Demographics and baseline characteristics
Out of the 202 patients, 57% of the patients were males and 43% were females. The greatest percentage of patients were Hispanic (45%), 22% were African American, 15% were Caucasian, and 18% were of unknown race. Ninety-three patients had a body mass index (BMI) above 30 kg/m 2  74 had a BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m 2 ; 28 patients were between 18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 ; and only seven patients had a BMI below 18.5 kg/m 2 . Out of 202 patients, 91 were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, 123 patients had hypertension, and only 24 patients had chronic kidney disease.
The Cellex qSARS-COV2 IgG/IgM rapid test was used for serological testing. The patients were divided into three categories based on the serological results. Nineteen percent (19%) of the patients were IgM+ and IgG -, 57% of the patients were IgM+, whereas 23% of the patients were IgM- and IgG -. Out of the 47 patients who were IgM-/ IgG-, 30% were both SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antigen-positive, 35% were only PCR-positive, and 34% were antigen-positive. The patients' distribution based on serology are summarized in Figure  1 .
Forty percent (40%) of the IgG-/IgM- group were females with a mean age of (SD), 36% were African Americans followed closely by Hispanics at 34%, 19 patients had a BMI above 30 and only four patients had a BMI below 18.5. In the IgG-/IgM- group, 19 patients were diagnosed cases of diabetes mellitus, 37 patients had hypertension, and 10 patients had chronic kidney disease. The IgM-positive subgroup had 116 patients, out of which 31% were both PCR and antigen-positive, 41% were females, and only eight patients were above 80 years of age. Based on race stratification, 51% were Hispanic, 18% were African American, and 13% were Caucasian. Fifty-five (55) patients were above 30 BMI, 63 patients had hypertension, 49 had diabetes, and 11 had chronic kidney disease. Forty-one percent (41%) of the 39 patients included in the IgM-/IgG + subgroup had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antigen. Fifty-one percent (51%) of these patients were females, 38% were Hispanic, 21% were Caucasian, and 18% were African American. Nineteen (19) patients had a BMI above 30, and there were 23 patients with diagnosed diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The detailed demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table  1 .
The mean duration of symptoms for the IgM-/IgG- subgroup was 4.068 with SD 2.706 (interquartile range (IQR) 2-6.75 days), whereas the mean duration of symptoms for the IgM+ subgroup was 7.974 (SD 8.594) with an IQR 4-9 days and the mean duration of symptoms for the IgM-/IgG+ subgroup was 6.718 (SD 6.070, IQR 2-8 days). The mean oxygen saturation in the IgM-/IgG- subgroup was 95.40 with SD ± 4.53 (IQR: 93% -99%). The mean oxygen saturation for the IgM+ subgroup was 92.05 SD± 8.20 (IQR: 91% -96%). In the IgM-/IgG+ subgroup, the mean was 94.41 (SD 3.29, IQR: 92% -96%) (Table  1 ).
Inflammatory markers and stage of disease
The results of inflammatory markers, including LDH, ferritin, CRP, and D-dimer were compared across the three subgroups based on the serological testing (IgG-/IgM-, IgM+, IgG+/IgM-) using the ANOVA test. When comparing the LDH across the three groups, there was a statistically significant difference between the IgM+ and IgM-/IgG+ subgroups with a p-value of 0.0061. The comparison of ferritin across the three subgroups showed similar results with a statistically significant difference between the IgM+ and IgM-/IgG+ subgroups (p-value 0.0013) (Figure  2 ).
The ANOVA for CRP showed a statistically significant difference between the IgM-/IgG- and IgM+ subgroups (P<0.0001) (Figure  3 ).
The comparison between D-dimer showed a statistically significant difference between the IgM-/IgG- and IgM+ subgroups with a p-value of 0.0452 (Figure  4 ).
Treatment and clinical course
The most common medications used in these patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 were remdesivir and dexamethasone. Analysis was done only in patients who received at least three days of a course of remdesivir. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the patients were in the IgM+ subgroup; 25% of these patients required mechanical ventilation with a survival percentage of 74%. Sixty-two percent (62%) were in the IgM-/IgG+ subgroup; only 4% required mechanical ventilation with no death. Forty-seven percent (47%) were in the IgM-/IgG- subgroup; 18% required mechanical ventilation in this subgroup and 25% of these patients expired. Dexamethasone was used in 55% of the patients in the IgM-/IgG- subgroup, 75% in the IgM+ subgroup, and 67% in the IgM-/IgG+ subgroup. The need for mechanical ventilation was most observed in the IgM+ subgroup (25%) out of which 77% expired. The use of remdesivir and clinical outcomes are summarized in Table  2 .
Outcome analysis
After analysis of the clinical outcome of the 202 patients, 16% of these patients required mechanical ventilation, whereas 84% of the patients were not intubated. Out of the 16% of patients who were intubated, 33% survived and 67% expired, whereas 98% of patients who did not require mechanical ventilation survived. Out of the 202 patients, only 12% expired and 88% survived. In the IgM-/IgG- group, 13% of the patients required mechanical ventilation and 67% of these patients survived. Twenty-two percent (22%) of the patients in the IgM+ group required mechanical ventilation and 25% of the patient on mechanical ventilation expired. Seventeen percent (17%) of the patients in the IgM+ group expired irrespective of the ventilation status. Only 5% of the patients required mechanical ventilation in the IgM-/IgG+ group. Ninety-five percent (95%) of the patients survived in the IgM-/IgG+ subgroup.
The need for mechanical ventilation was compared between the IgM-/IgG+ and IgM-/IgG- with the IgM+ subgroups, which was statistically significant (P-value 0.0198) (Figure  5 ).
Similarly, the comparison of outcome between the IgM-/IgG+ and IgM-/IgG- with the IgM+ subgroup was also significant with a p-value of 0.0146 (Figure  6 ).
When associating inflammatory markers with the stage of disease, LDH and ferritin were statistically significant in subacute disease (IgM positive) and late disease (IgM negative/IgG positive) (p-value of 0.0061 and p-value of 0.0013, respectively) (Figure  2 ). The CRP and D-dimer showed a statistically significant difference between acute disease (IgM-/IgG-) and subacute disease (IgM+ subgroups) (P <0.0001 and p-value of 0.0452, respectively) (Figures  3 - 4 ).
Causes of death
The cause of death of the patients in the three groups was analyzed and identified. One of the patients with IgG and IgM negative had a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and died due to the progression of viral pneumonia in the setting of an immunocompromised state. Another patient with IgG and IgM negative had a history of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and died due to cardiac arrest. The third patient with IgG and IgM negative had uncontrolled HIV and died due to the progression of viral pneumonia. Of the two patients with IgM negative and IgG positive, one died of a cardiac arrest and the other patient refused mechanical ventilation and died of respiratory failure. In patients in the IgM positive subgroup, one died of respiratory failure with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Six patients died of respiratory failure with sepsis, seven patients died of respiratory failure with multiple organ failure, and one patient died of a cause unrelated to COVID-19 (Table  3 ).
