An estimated 2.74 million deaths were reported worldwide a year after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emerged [ 1 ]; multiple risk factors for mortality have been identified, but it is still unclear why some patients have a worse prognosis compared to others. It is well-established that patients with several comorbidities and those who suffer from a “cytokine storm” have worse disease progression and outcome [ 2 ]. The current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend the use of certain drugs based on disease severity determined by oxygen saturation cutoffs, oxygen requirements, time since onset of symptoms, and imaging features [ 3 ]. Furthermore, the IDSA guidelines recommend the use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and according to them, it is not recommended to use serologic testing for diagnosis or prognosis during the first two weeks after symptoms onset [ 4 - 5 ]. If serology is required for clinical or epidemiological purposes, it is recommended by the IDSA to test for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies three to four weeks after symptom onset. Finally, regarding IgM antibodies, IDSA has no recommendations for or against using IgM antibodies to detect early infection [ 5 ].
Many established viral infections are diagnosed and managed according to their serologies and their time since the onset of symptoms. For example, hepatitis B virus infection is diagnosed and managed based on whether patients have positive hepatitis B core IgM or not. Moreover, studies of influenza virus suggest that early treatment with oseltamivir is more efficacious [ 6 - 9 ]. Regarding COVID-19 and remdesivir use, for example, the IDSA guidelines have not been using serologies or time since the onset of symptoms as determinants for eligibility. It is currently recommended to use remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19 that is defined as oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 94% on room air, or in those requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation (ECMO) [ 10 - 12 ].
It is currently well-established that SARS-CoV-2 clinical manifestations vary with age and comorbid conditions; it covers a wide range of symptoms, spanning from asymptomatic to severe organ damage and death. The first stage of COVID-19 disease is the attachment of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptors mainly in the respiratory system, followed by an immune response that often results in clearing of the infection; in some instances, this immune reaction leads to a “cytokine storm” with persistent fever, worsening shortness of breath, and multiorgan involvement. It is also well accepted that a hypercoagulable state can develop later during the disease. Although inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation was found to correlate with the cytokine phase, and, probably, the D-dimer level would correlate with a hypercoagulable state, it could be helpful for clinicians to recognize, with as much accuracy as possible, the stage of the disease the patient is currently in when managing such complicated illness, in order to optimize their treatment.
