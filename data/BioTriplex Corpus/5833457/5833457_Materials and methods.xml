Cell culture and transfections
H9C2 rat cardiomyoblasts (CRL-1446, ATCC, Wesel, Germany) were cultured in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM), 1 g/l low glucose, 2 mM  l -glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2  atmosphere.
For stable transfections, H9C2 were plated at a density of 5 × 10 5  cells/100-mm tissue culture dish in antibiotic-free DMEM containing 10% FBS, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 . In total, 60–70% confluent cells were transfected using IBAfect reagent, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a pool of plasmids codifying for three shRNAs (188A12, 566F3, and 526A3) targeting NAGLU or with a control plasmid codifying for a non-targeting shRNA (Open Biosystems, Lafayette, CO, USA). Forty-eight hours later, transfected H9C2 were selected in the presence of 0.4 μg/ml of puromycin and subjected to enzymatic activity assay to identify the stable NAGLU-silenced clones. Stable clones were grown in the same culture medium of H9C2 supplemented with 0.4 μg/ml of puromycin for the all experimentation.
For transient transfections, H9C2 clones were plated at 2.5 × 10 5  cells/60-mm tissue culture dish 24 h prior to transfection. Transfections with plasmid vectors codifying for c-Src DN and WT, and control vector-GFP 55 , kindly provided by Prof. A. Feliciello (University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy), were carried out using IBAfect reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 h, transfected H9C2 clones were collected for molecular analyses.
Transient transfections of H9C2 clones with HB-EGF siRNA (#AM16708, siRNAID 48748, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and with a non-targeting siRNA (#AM4611, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (#13778100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10 nM siRNA, and after 48 h, transfected H9C2 clones were collected for molecular analyses.
Enzyme activity assay
To determine NAGLU enzymatic activity in stable clones, pellets from 5 × 10 5  cells of each clone were collected, submitted to 10 freeze thaw cycles, and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentration of samples was determined by the Lowry method. NAGLU enzymatic activity of each clone was measured as described by Marsh and Fensom using 4-methylumbelliferyl- N -acetyl-α- d -glucosaminide as fluorogenic substrate 56 . Enzymatic activity was normalized for total protein concentration, and hydrolysis of 1 nmol of substrate per hour per milligram of protein was defined as one catalytic unit.
Fluorescence microscopy
LysoTracker was used to label lysosomes 57 . Briefly, live cell clones grown on a coverslip were incubated with LysoTracker probe for 1 h at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in PBS.
Phalloidin was used to label actin cytoskeleton. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed with 4% PFA solution in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with 50 μg/ml TRITC-conjugated phalloidin for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, nuclei were counterstained with DAPI for 15 min.
Lectin was used to label HS. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed with 4% PFA solution in PBS. After washing in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and stained with 50 μg/ml fluorescent lectin conjugate, lectin-FITC, in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.
After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted with 1:1 PBS/glycerol solution, and observed under a confocal fluorescence microscope. Images were collected using a laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510 META, Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.) equipped with a planapo x63 oil immersion (NA 1.4) objective lens using the same setting conditions (e.g., laser power and detector gain) in control and silenced clones.
Morphometric and image quantitative analyses were performed with LSM software. In particular, the drawing tool was used to measure the relative dimensions and cell area. Fluorescence intensity of random chosen areas of same size was measured 58 .
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA from H9C2 stable clones was extracted using Trizol reagent following the manufacturer’s instruction. Five hundred nanograms of RNA were reverse transcribed for cDNA synthesis with Iscript RT-PCR system (Bio-rad Laboratories). Reverse transcription of the RNAs was followed by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) performed with the SYBR Green real-time PCR master mix kit (FS Universal SYBR Green MasterRox/Roche Applied Science) as previously described 59 . The reactions were visualized by SYBR Green analysis (Applied Biosystem Inc, Foster City, CA, USA) on StepOne instrument (Applied Biosystem). Primers used for gene analysis were the following: ANP-Forward: 5′-GGAGCAAATCCCGTATACAGTGCG-3′, Reverse: 5′-GCGGAGGCAT GACCTCATCTTCTAC-3′; BNP-Forward: 5′-CTGGGAAGTCCTAGCCAG TCTC-3′; Reverse: 5′-CCGGAAGGCGCTGTCTTGAGACC-3′; HB-EGF-Forward: 5′-GGACTACTGCATCCAC GGAGAGT-3′; HB-EGF-Reverse: 5′-CCACCACAGCCAAGACGGTAGT-3′; NAGLU-Forward: 5′-GGCCAGGAGGCCATCTGGC-3′; Reverse: 5′-CCCAGGCCAGGAA GGCAGG-3′; S18-Forward: 5′-AAACGGCTACCACATCCAAG-3′; Reverse: 5′-CCTCCAAT GGATCCTCGTTAA-3′. All standards and samples were assayed in triplicate. Thermal cycling was initiated with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min. After this initial step, 40 cycles of PCR were performed. Each PCR cycle consisted of heating at 95 °C for 30 s for melting, 55 °C for 30 s for annealing, and 72 °C for 30 s for the extension. To calculate the relative expression levels, we used the 2 -ΔΔCT  method  60 .
Western blotting
Cells, grown to sub-confluence in standard medium, were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor cocktail tablet, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate) 61 . The lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice, and supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 ×  g . Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford assay, and 25 or 50 μg/lane of total proteins were separated on SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes 62 . Membranes were treated with a blocking buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 5% non-fat powdered milk for 1 h at room temperature 63 . Incubation with the primary antibody was carried out overnight at 4 °C. After washings, membranes were incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following further washings of the membranes, chemiluminescence was generated by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amesharm, Little Chalfont, UK). Densitometric analyses were performed using the NIH Image software (Bethesda, MD, USA).
Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (phospho-RTK) array
The Phospho-RTK Array (ARY001B, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) is a rapid and sensitive tool to detect changes in phosphorylation between samples. The array, which allows the screening of 49 different phosphorylated RTKs, was performed as here briefly described. All reagents and samples were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An aliquot of 2 ml of Array Buffer 1 was pipetted into each well of the 4-well multi-dish as a blocking buffer; each array was placed into each well of the 4-well multi-dish and incubated for 1 h at room temperature on a rocking platform shaker. Samples were prepared by diluting the desired quantity (50 μg of proteins) of cell lysates to a final volume of 1.5 ml with Array Buffer 1, and incubated overnight at 2–8 °C on a rocking platform shaker pre-blocked membrane. Each array was carefully placed into individual plastic containers with 2 ml of 1× Wash Buffer, and the 4-well multi-dish was rinsed with deionized or distilled water, and dried thoroughly. Each array was washed with 1× Wash Buffer for 10 min on a rocking platform shaker for three times. The anti-phospho-tyrosine-HRP detection antibody was finally diluted in 1× Array Buffer 2, and added to each array for 2 h at room temperature on a rocking platform shaker. Each array was washed three times with 2 ml of 1× Wash Buffer for 10 min on a rocking platform shaker. Membranes were incubated with 1 ml of the prepared Chemi Reagent Mix for 1 min. Membranes were exposed with an autoradiography film cassette to an X-ray film for 1–10 min. For the data analysis, the positive signal seen on developed film was identified by placing the transparency overlay template on the array image and aligning it with the pairs of reference spots in the three corners of each array. Reference spots are included to align the transparency overlay template and to demonstrate that the array has been incubated with anti-phospho-tyrosine-HRP during the assay procedure.
Statistical analysis
Data reported are expressed as the mean ± SD of at least three separate experiments. Statistical significance was determined by Student’s  t  test. A value of  P  < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
