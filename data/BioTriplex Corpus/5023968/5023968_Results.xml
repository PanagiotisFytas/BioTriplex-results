  in PV cells regulates perisomatic inhibition
All studies were carried out using PV-Cre knockin mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (B6;129P2- Pvalb tm1(cre)Arbr /J). To validate the expression of Cre recombinase in these mice, we crossed them with the Ai9 line of reporter mice expressing a flexed tdTomato knocked in to the Rosa26 locus to generate mice expressing tdTomato in cells expressing Cre; the fraction of PV cells that also expressed tdTomato, and thus Cre recombinase in visual cortex, was then measured at three ages (postnatal days 28, 40 and 60) by immuno-staining against PV in fixed, frozen coronal sections. At P28, 92 of 93 PV cells counted in three sections (99%) were co-labelled; at P40 this ratio was 166/168 (99%), and at P60 it was 166/184 (90%), indicating that the PV-Cre line of mice reliably express Cre recombinase and tdTomato in virtually all PV cells ( Fig. 1 ). These values are similar to those reported in ref.  12 .
To examine the impact of  Pten  haploinsufficiency on PV cell circuitry, we expressed the light-activated cationic channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), in PV cells of PV- Pten +/−  and littermate control mice; subsequently laser scanning photo-stimulation of ChR2-expressing PV cells with concurrent whole-cell recordings of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons was used to measure the strength of PV cell input to pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex in acute brain slices (P35-P56). We note that mapping studies based on ChR2 expression may be confounded by differences in the optical recruitment of PV cells. With this approach, we found that PV cells hemizygous for  Pten  produced only half of the total inhibitory drive to pyramidal cells of wild-type PV cells ( Fig. 2 ;  Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 ). This reduced inhibitory current could not be attributed to a reduced expression of ChR2 or responsiveness to blue light stimulation ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ), or to changes in the intrinsic properties of PV cells in the experimental group ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ), as these measures were comparable between PV cells hemizygous for Pten and controls. Nor was it due to a reduction in the number of PV cells in mutants (Cells per field of view visualized using a × 4 objective lens with a field number of 26.5; mean and standard deviation: WT=354 +/− 40; Pten=367 +/− 60; 10 fields of view per group;  P =0.73, Wilcoxon rank sum).
This reduction in PV cell-derived inhibitory current could result from pyramidal neurons receiving fewer PV cell-derived inhibitory synapses; these synapses could be present in normal numbers, but weaker synapses; or it could be some combination of these two. If there are fewer synapses, this would be reflected in a decrease in connectivity. If the synapses are weaker, this would be reflected in a decrease in paired-pulse ratio. To directly measure these, we conducted paired whole-cell recordings from adjacent PV cells and pyramidal neurons and, separately, from adjacent pairs of PV cells ( Fig. 3 ). Recordings were done in L2/3 of the primary visual cortex of young adult mice (P35–56). PV cells were identified by their expression of td-Tomato, high frequency firing pattern, narrow action potentials and sharp after-hyperpolarizations. Pyramidal neurons were identified by their lack of td-Tomato expression and the presence of an accommodating firing pattern (cf.  Fig. 3a ). Connectivity between the two cells was assessed by stimulating the presynaptic neuron in current clamp and recording from the putative postsynaptic neuron in voltage clamp (cf.  Fig. 3b ). PV cells hemizygous for  Pten  exhibited a 32% decrease in probability of connecting to adjacent pyramidal neurons relative to controls ( Fig. 3c ). This 32% reduction is a measure of connectivity and is distinct from the 50% reduction in total PV cell-derived inhibitory current in pyramidal neurons reported in  Fig. 1 , which is a measure of total input strength. Notably, the probability of finding the reverse connection, from pyramidal cell to PV cell hemizygous for Pten was no different from control; nor was there any change in the probability of connection between mutant PV cells and between normal PV cells ( Fig. 3c ).
When we examined the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in these slices, we found a trend towards increased excitability in PV- Pten +/−  mice ( Fig. 3d ; only comparisons at 150 pA had a  P  value <0.05, no other comparisons revealed significant differences). This data trend could be due to a true change in the intrinsic properties of these excitatory neurons, despite having normal  Pten  copy number, or it could simply be an epiphenomenon of the reduction in inhibition in these slices, one result of which would be an increase in recurrent excitatory response following the firing of the recorded excitatory neuron. Supporting this latter view, the data trend towards increased excitability was erased when all synaptic transmission was blocked by application of AMPAR, NMDAR and GABA a R antagonists (CNQX, APV, picrotoxin;  Fig. 3e ;  P =0.92, Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)). These paired recordings show that PV cells hemizygous for  Pten  have normal intrinsic membrane properties, but establish fewer synapses onto local pyramidal neurons.
To determine whether the synapse that are established by the mutant PV cells are of normal strength, we measured response amplitudes and paired pulse ratio of extant connections. We found no significant differences in response amplitudes in any of the types of synapses examined; PV to pyramidal, pyramidal to PV, and PV to PV were all comparable between PV-Pten +/−  mice and controls ( Fig. 3f-h ). Measures of paired pulse ratio were also equivalent ( Fig. 3i ). These measures indicate that the synapses established by mutant PV cells onto local pyramidal neurons are as strong as synapses established by normal PV cells.
Taken together, these findings show that single copy  Pten  loss in PV cells reduces the probability that any given PV cell will establish a connection with a local pyramidal neuron; this, in turn, causes a significant reduction in the strength of perisomatic inhibition. This effect is specific to the connection between PV cells and pyramidal cells.
Mutant PV cells express high levels of EphB4
We next examined how a reduction in Pten expression could result in decreased, synapse-specific connectivity between PV cells and pyramidal neurons. Since PTEN is a phosphatase that negatively regulates the AKT signalling pathway, which in turn regulates gene transcription and protein translation 13 , we screened for possible differences in gene expression in  Pten +/−  and wild-type PV cells. To do so, live PV cells were harvested from the primary visual cortex of intact adult brains via fluorescence-assisted laser cell sorting ( Fig. 4a,b ). RNA from live PV cells was isolated and amplified, and complementary DNA libraries synthesized. Transcript copy number was quantified using Illumina mouse gene chip arrays, with a total of 26,500 genes screened ( Fig. 4c ). Seventeen transcripts met established criteria for further examination, as described in ref.  14 , namely a >1.4-fold change in expression (logFC>0.5) and a  P -value <0.001 ( Table 1 ). Of these, the majority encoded intracellular glycosylation proteins. One standout transcript was  EphB4  (logFC=0.56,  P =0.00039), which encodes the presynaptic partner of ephrinB2 15 . Quantitative real-time PCR (ddCt=1.84) confirmed that  Ephb4  RNA was in fact increased in PV cells hemizygous for  Pten .
These data suggest a model in which Pten expression in PV cells suppresses expression of EphB4 in these same cells. In the central nervous system, ephrinB/EphB signalling mediates cell-to-cell repulsion during development 16 17 18 . Supporting this view, RNA sequencing data of adult mouse primary visual cortical neurons, published from the Allen Brain Institute, shows high expression of EphrinB2 in pyramidal neurons; Pten, but not EphB4 is expressed in adult PV cells (see http://casestudies.brain-map.org/celltax). Increased expression of EphB4 in PV cells could account for the reduction in PV to pyramidal inhibitory synapses via increased repulsion between the presynaptic terminals of PV cells and cell bodies of pyramidal neurons.
EphB4 overexpression dismantles perisomatic inhibition
To directly test whether increased EphB4 signalling in PV cells is sufficient to prevent the normal formation of perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons, we selectively over-expressed  Ephb4  in mature, genotypically normal PV cells in the primary visual cortex of mice expressing ChR2 under the PV promoter (PV-Cre/Ai32) via viral transduction of  Ephb4  (AAV2/1-Syn.flex.mCherry.D2A.mEphB4;  Fig. 5a-c ) and then mapped net PV cell-mediated inhibition across all cortical layers onto individual pyramidal neurons via laser scanning photo-stimulation of ChR2 expressing PV cells with concurrent whole-cell recordings of pyramidal neurons as in  Fig. 1 . Control recordings were obtained from PV-Cre/Ai32 mice that received the same viral injection but failed to express  Ephb4 . A 67% reduction in local PV mediated inhibition of pyramidal neurons was observed in mice overexpressing  Ephb4  ( Fig. 5d-f ), supporting the view that EphB4 signalling in PV cells impairs the formation of perisomatic inhibitory synapses.
Early vision increases Pten and suppresses EphB4 in PV cells
Since visual experience is required for the formation of perisomatic inhibition in visual cortex, we wondered whether vision also informs levels of Pten and EphB4 expression in PV cells. To do so, we reared PV-Pten +/−  mice and littermate controls in darkness from birth until postnatal day 35. PV cells in these mice also expressed the red fluorescent protein tdTomato. Using fluorescent-assisted laser cell sorting to extract live PV cells and subsequent qrtPCR normalized to GAPDH expression, we found a ∼3-fold increase in EphB4 expression in PV cells from dark reared mice relative to normally reared controls, and an ∼40% reduction in Pten expression ( Fig. 6 ). These data support a model in which visual experience, at least in part, regulates the expression of EphB4 and Pten in primary visual cortex.
