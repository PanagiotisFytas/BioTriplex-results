PV-Cre +/− /Ai9 +/− / Pten 
 loxP+/−  mice
To genetically label PV-positive neurons, PV-IRES-cre knock-in female mice (Jackson Laboratories, stock#008069, generated by S Arber, FMI 27 ) were crossed with male TdTomato reporter knock-in mice (Jackson Laboratories, stock #007905, ‘Ai9', generated by H Zeng, Allen Brain Institute 28 ). Offspring were hemizygous for both transgenes. These mice were then back-crossed with PV-Cre mice to generate offspring that were homozygous for PV-Cre and hemizygous for Ai9. Using separate breeders, we also generated mice that were hemizygous for both Ai9 and a floxed Pten 29 . PV-Cre +/+ /Ai9 +/−  mice were then crossed with Ai9 +/− /Pten loxP+/−  mice to generate offspring hemizygous for Cre, Ai9 and Pten in PV cells. Littermate controls were hemizygous for Cre and Ai9 in PV cells, but expressed both copies of Pten.
PV-Cre +/− /Ai32 +/− / Pten 
 loxP+/−  mice
To generate mice in which a single copy of  Pten  was deleted from PV cells, we first crossed  Pten loxP+/−  mice with mice homozygous for a conditional knock-in allele of ChR2-YFP (Jackson Laboratories, stock #012569, ‘Ai32', generated by H Zeng, Allen Brain Institute 30 ). Resulting offspring were genotyped and mice hemizygous for ChR2-YFP and  Pten loxP+/−  were crossed with PV-Cre +/+ /Ai32 +/−  mice to generate PV-Cre +/− /Ai32 +/− / Pten loxP+/−  mice expressing a YFP-tagged ChR2 in PV cells that were either hemizygous for  Pten  (experimental) or expressed both copies of  Pten  (littermate controls).
ChR2-assisted circuit mapping
Briefly, whole-cell recordings were obtained from pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex of PV-Cre +/− /Ai32 +/− / Pten loxP+/−  mice and littermate controls. Spatial maps of PV connectivity strength to each patched pyramidal neuron were derived by systematically stimulating ChR2-expressing PV cells at 256 different sites arranged in a 16 × 16 matrix spanning all cortical layers 31 . Spatially restricted optogenetic activating of ChR2-expressing PV cells was accomplished using a 473 nm blue laser (30 mW, 0.25 ms). Voltage and current clamp controls were performed to normalize light stimulation protocols between slices and across animals. During optogenetic stimulation experiments, the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (10 μM CNQX and 5 μM CCP) were added to the bath solution to block excitatory synaptic input (GABAergic transmission is unaffected) and avoid any potential dis-inhibition effects. Because interneurons can also be connected by electrical synapses, we blocked gap junctions using 100 μM carbenoxolone. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from the recorded pyramidal neurons to measure photoactivation-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents at the empirically determined holding potential at +5 mV in voltage clamp mode with cesium-containing internal solution.
We validated the effectiveness of our approach as follows: following sufficiently high ChR2 expression in the cortex of the cross-bred pups (PV-Cre:Ai32), living brain slices were prepared and whole-cell recordings were obtained from ChR2/YFP-expressing PV cells that exhibited robust photoactivation-evoked spikes to repeated laser flashes (473 nm, 30 mW). To map their local functional outputs, whole-cell recordings from targeted excitatory and inhibitory neurons were combined with focal photoactivation (laser spot diameter, ∼50 μm) of ChR2+ inhibitory neurons to assess functional connectivity and synaptic properties. As ChR2-expressing PV cells only fire action potentials to photoactivation (0.25 ms, 30 mW) close to the cell body, we found that ChR2 photoactivation had sufficient spatial precision for laminar circuit mapping.
For ChR2-evoked PV+ synaptic input analysis, we used the 3 ‘hit' criterion, and only map locations with three detected inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were selected for further map construction ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The IPSC peaks were detected within the window of between 3 and 50 ms to each laser flash, with a threshold determined by background spontaneous IPSCs. The average IPSC input amplitude/strength of each stimulation site was measured by normalizing the sum of individual IPSCs from each photostimulation site by the analysis durations; this average integrated value was expressed in pA. We quantified the total PV+ IPSC inputs (total current) for the recorded individual cells by summing the input values across all map locations. The individual maps from different neurons were aligned to generate group averaged maps, using the 4 × bright field images that were acquired during experiments to guide and register photostimulation sites. We used laminar cytoarchitectonic landmarks as well as the pial surface and white matter. These routine processes have been described in ref.  32 .
Paired patch recordings
Brains were dissected from adult (P35-56) male and female mice. Three hundred and fifty micrometre coronal cortical slices were cut containing the visual cortex. All recordings were done at 33–35 °C. Recordings were made in L2/3 at depths greater than 50 μm from the surface of each slice. PV cells were identified by their td-Tomato expression as well as their unique firing pattern, characterized by narrow action potentials, sharp after-hyperpolarization and fast firing rate. Pyramidal neurons were identified by their lack of td-Tomato expression, as well as their accommodating and slower firing pattern. Only cells with access resistance <25 MΩ were included in the subsequent analysis. Initial assessment of firing pattern was done in current clamp (IC) at resting membrane potential with current injections at 50 pA increments. Assessment of connectivity between pairs was done with the presynaptic cell in current clamp (VC) and the putative postsynaptic cell in VC.
Fluorescent-activated cell sorting
Fluorescent-activated cell sorting was performed at the UCLA Flow Cytometry Core using a FacsARIA cell sorter. In brief, 500 μm thick coronal slices containing the visual cortex were cut in standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). A Worthington Biochemical Papain Dissociation kit was used to dissolve the extracellular matrix to obtain individual cells, which were then filtered through a 70 μm diameter mesh and labelled with the dead cell stain 7AAD. Cells were laser sorted for peridin-chlorophyll protein complex (PerCP) signals (7AAD) and phycoerythrin (PE) signals (td-Tomato). Cells from wild-type animals with no fluorescent proteins were used to calibrate PerCP and PE signals each time. Cells with high PE signals and low PerCP signals were collected. We looked to obtain greater than 60,000 live PV cells per sorting session.
RNA amplification
RNA from collected PV cells was extracted with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit and then stored at −80 °C. RNA quality and quantity were assessed with the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RNA Integrity Number >8 were subsequently used. cRNA was then generated and amplified with the NuGEN Ultra Low Mass kit (Ovation).
Microarray
Microarray experiments were performed at the UCLA Neuroscience Genomics Core. cRNA levels were measured using Illumina mouse arrays (MouseWG-6 v2.0 BeadChip). Identification of differential gene expression was accomplished by first normalizing the gene expression of each sample and then comparing the gene expression of  Pten +/−  PV cells with that of wild-type (PV-Cre: Ai9) brains. Differential expression analysis was determined by calculating the log2 fold change (logFC), defined as the ratio of intensities between the two experimental conditions under comparison. For all comparisons, a gene was considered differentially expressed if it had a corrected  P -value≤0.001, and a logFC⩾0.5 (⩾ 1.4-fold increased or decreased expression).
qrt-PCR
Real-time quantitative PCR of the same cRNA libraries was used to validate hits (here,  Ephb4 ). Approximately 300–500 ng of RNA from the amplified control and PTEN+/− samples was set aside prior to the microarray experiments. Thus, qrtPCR was performed on the same samples used in the microarray experiments. Total RNA from each sample was treated with DNAse 1 and converted into cDNA. Assays were performed in triplicate and analysed using an ABI 7700 instrument. The fold change was calculated using both standard curve analysis and the Pfaffl method.
Immunostaining
P16-P42 mice were perfused with 1 × PBS followed by 4% PFA. Brains were removed and stored in 4% PFA overnight and transferred to a 30% sucrose solution with 0.05% NaN3 prior to cryosectioning. Brains were cryosectioned in the sagittal or coronal plane through primary visual cortex at 50 μm thickness per section. Free-floating sections were washed three times with 1 × PBS prior to being placed in a 2 N HCl solution for 17 min for antigen retrieval of EphB4. They were subsequently washed three times in 1 × PBS and blocked with 15% Normal Goat Serum in 0.5% Triton for 1.5 h at room temperature. The sections were then placed in a solution containing a monoclonal mouse anti-EphB4 primary antibody (1:50, Invitrogen) with 0.5% Triton overnight on a shaker in 4 °C. The following day, slices were washed and incubated with an Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) for 2.5 h at room temperature on a shaker.
AAV-EphB4 virus injection
Through a 2.5 mm craniotomy centred on primary visual cortex, we made 3–4 injections of AAV2/1-e/Syn.FlexON.mCherry-T2AmEphB4 (1.2 × 10̂13 GC/ml). Injection sites were roughly 200 μm apart (forming a triangle with three injection sites or a square with four injection sites). Thin walled glass pipettes were pulled to have a long tapered tip with an opening that is <1 μm wide. The glass pipette was filled with ∼2 μl of virus and the tip of the pipette was gently broken using a Kimwipe to allow a small drop of virus to push through. The pipette was lowered to a depth of 300 μm below the surface of the cortex. Using a pressure of 15–20 psi, 1 msec puffs of virus were given 40–50 times with 2 s separating each puff. Then, the pipette was raised 50 μm towards the surface of the cortex and again 30–40 puffs were injected. This was repeated for every 50 μm up to 100 μm below the pial surface. Mice were euthanized 3 weeks post injection to allow sufficient time for EphB4 expression. Cortical slices prepared and ChR2-assisted circuit mapping was conducted as above.
Statistical analyses and graphs
All data are reported as mean±standard error of the mean, except for data in  Fig. 3c  where the probability of connection is reported between patched pairs of cells. Significance in  Fig. 3c  was determined using Fisher's exact test. For the remaining data sets, when comparing two independent groups, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. In the case more than two independent groups were compared a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA was used and followed by  post-hoc  comparisons when justified (alpha set to 0.05) using Wicoxon rank-sum tests. In the cases where more than two groups were compared and the groups were not independent, a repeated measures ANOVA (Friedman's test) was used. In all cases, sample size is defined as cell number.
Data availability
All analyses were conducted in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). The code and data are available on request from the authors
