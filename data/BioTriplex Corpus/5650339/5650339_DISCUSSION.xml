Accumulating evidence shows that miR-146a is implicated in cell growth and metastasis in various cancers, of which the dysregulation of miR-146a is associated with pathological staging, poor differentiation and distant metastasis, acting as an independent prognostic element for overall survival in gastric cancer [ 25 ,  26 ] and lung cancer [ 27 ]. In addition, miR-146a polymorphism rs2910164 is linked to the risk of esophageal cancer and colorectal cancers [ 28 ,  29 ]. In this study, we analyzed the correlation of miR-146a with clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of OS patients, which indicated that increased expression of miR-146a was positively linked to tumor size and OS recurrence, but Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that miR-146a was not an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and recurrence for OS patients, unveiling that miR-146a might be a potential biomarker for OS patients.
Functionally, in terms of the diversity of tissue expressions and the difference in target gene function, imiR-146a can act as an oncogene [ 12 - 14 ] or a tumor suppressor [ 21 - 24 ] in a variety of malignancies. miR-146a inhibits cell invasion in pancreatic cancer via inhibition of EGFR and NF-kB pathways [ 30 ], weakens the metastatic potential in breast cancer [ 31 ] and reduces epithelial-mesenchymal transition of esophageal carcinoma [ 32 ]. But, the function of miR-146a in human OS tissues is elusive. To confirm its role in human OS, our results showed that knockdown of miR-146a inhibited growth and colony formation  in vitro  and  in vivo , revealing the tumor-promoting role of miR-146a in OS cells.
ZNRF3 as a member of E3 ubiquitin ligases family is downregulated in gastric cancer [ 33 ] and papillary thyroid carcinoma [ 34 ] and colorectal cancer [ 35 ], and inhibits cell growth and invasion and induces apoptosis via regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [ 33 ,  36 ]. MiR-93 promotes growth of lung cancer cells via ZNRF3/Wnt/β-catenin axis [ 37 ], and ZNRF3 suppresses the tumorigenesis and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling [ 38 ]. Intriguingly, we also found that ZNRF3 was a direct target of miR-146a in OS cells and was negatively correlated with miR-146a expression in OS tissues; Overexpression of ZNRF3 repressed cell growth and rescued the tumor-promoting role of miR-146a via inhibition of GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling, indicating that miR-146a might promote OS tumorigenicity via targeting ZNRF3/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling (Figure  8 ).
Taken together, our study demonstrates that miR-146a is highly expressed in OS tissues and has the positive correlation with tumor size and high recurrence of OS patients. Restoration of miR-146a expression promotes OS cell growth via targeting ZNRF3/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway, and represents a promising biomarker for OS patients.
