Patients
From the database of patients at The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Jiangsu, China, from January 2011 to November 2019, we identified 24 consecutive adult patients with pathologically confirmed PaC and DM. Another cohort of unmatched 24 patients with PaC but without DM (non-DM) was randomly selected from the database. The patients with other cancers, undergoing radiotherapy/chemotherapy, with incomplete data, or lost to follow-up were excluded. The patient characteristics are described in  Table 1 . This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The First People's Hospital of Changzhou. Informed consent was obtained from each patient.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
IHC was performed using the EliVision TM  method (Maixin-Bio, Fuzhou, China). Duodenum tissue samples were obtained during surgery and fixed in 4% formalin. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections (3-4-µm thick) were prepared. The sections were dewaxed in xylene and dehydrated in ethanol, followed by incubation with 3% H 2 O 2  for 15 min. After additional incubation with 10% normal bovine serum for 10 min, each slide was incubated with primary antibodies against human P-gp (MAB-0237, MXB Biotechnologies, China) or CYP3A4 (ab3572, Abcam, UK) at 4°C overnight. The protein expression was visualized using an ultraView universal DAB detection kit (Ventana, Roche, USA). The positive and negative controls were provided by the manufacturer. The results were blindly scored (0-100%) by two independent pathologists using an Olympus IX73 microscope (Olympus Corp., Japan) and the following algorithm: [(3 × intensity of specific immunodetection) + (2 × amount of immunodetected structures) + (2 × intensity of non-specific immunodetection) + (1 × intensity of contrast) + (1 × preservation of morphology)] × 3703 (constant that allows conversion to the 0-100 score), as previously described ( 22 ). Five randomly selected fields were scored in each slide. The final score is reported as the average of the scores of two pathologists. A reassessment was performed when the deviation was ≥20%.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS software (version 19.0; IBM, USA). Data are reported as median (range). Comparison between two groups was conducted using the chi-squared test or unpaired Student's  t -test. Differences between categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test. The survival of patients with PaC was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
