Bee sting injuries can lead to both local reactions like erythema at the site of the sting and systemic reactions like severe anaphylaxis, demyelination, and shock [ 1 ]. This occurs due to the toxic and immunologic response to a mixture of mediators like histamine, dopamine, polypeptide toxins, enzymes like phospholipase and hyaluronidase present in the bee venom. The reactions generally occur within minutes but can be delayed, too. Ocular changes have been reported involving the cornea [ 1 ], [ 2 ] and the optic nerve [ 3 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ], [ 6 ], [ 7 ].
Ocular changes involving the retina [ 8 ] have been reported following a wasp sting but not a bee sting injury. Our patient presented with conjunctival hyperemia at the site of the sting, anterior uveitis, vitritis, mild disc hyperaemia, and retinal striae at the macula (pupil could not be assessed because of mydriatic use at that time). The histamine present in the bee sting leads to increase in the capillary permeability and can be the cause for the conjunctival hyperaemia at the site of the sting as well as the presence of cells in the anterior chamber. It is possible that the chemicals present in the bee sting might have entered the vitreous cavity leading to an area of localised vitritis. There has been a single report of ciliochoroidal detachment following a bee sting injury [ 7 ]. The initial intraocular pressure of our patient measured with Goldmann applanation tonometry was low; this could be due to hypotony caused by an abnormal accumulation of serous fluid in the choroid which might not have been clinically evident because of the overlying vitritis. Our patient had mild disc hyperaemia but the microperimetry reports were normal. Maltzmann et al. reviewed seven cases of optic neuropathy following a bee sting injury and found that optic disc edema, hyperaemia, and small disc hemorrhages were consistent findings in five patients [ 7 ]. Perimetry reportedly revealed central or caeco-central scotomas in all but the mildest case, which demonstrated only an enlarged blind spot in the affected eye. Relative afferent pupillary defects (RAPD) were reported in two cases. Our patient developed traumatic mydriasis and a sluggish reaction to light, detected after topical medications were discontinued. This could be due to a neurotoxic effect of the toxins. Our patient developed few retinal striae at the macula; this could be due to the ocular hypotony. Only a single case involving the retina where the electroretinography recordings became unrecordable has been reported, and that too following a wasp sting injury [ 8 ]. Our patient was treated with systemic steroids and steroids, antibiotics and cycloplegic agents. Three weeks after initiating treatment, the vision improved to 20/20 and the cellular reaction in the anterior chamber and the vitreous cavity reduced dramatically. The patient was followed-up for sixteen months. His vision was maintained at 20/20. The fundus appeared stable except for the stigmata of injury in the form of a localised area of chorioretinal atrophy in the infero-nasal quadrant. This is a rare case report of a bee sting injury leading to anterior uveitis, vitritis and ciliary detachment, mimicking endophthalmitis. Timely recognition of the cause of inflammation and appropriate treatment led to an optimal recovery.
