A 19-year-old man presented to our emergency services with a ten-day history of decreased vision in the right eye following a bee sting injury. The patient had been treated by a local Ophthalmologist who initiated treatment with topical antibiotics, steroids, and cycloplegic agents. At presentation, best corrected visual activity (BCVA) was 20/60 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. Examination revealed a localised area of conjunctival congestion and sloughing, inferonasal to limbus indicating the site of the sting injury (Figure 1  (Fig. 1) ). Examination of the right eye revealed a pharmacologically dilated pupil, clear cornea and lens, 1+ cell in the anterior chamber, and 3+ cells in the vitreous cavity. Intraocular pressure (Goldman applanation) was 6 mmHg in the right eye, and 16 mmHg
in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed mild vitreous haze, mild disc hyperemia, and retinal striae at the macula (Figure 2  (Fig. 2) ). The retinal details could not be seen clearly in the inferonasal fundus quadrant. The treatment already initiated elsewhere was continued and systemic steroids (oral Prednisolone 1 mg/kg) were added for the shallow, localized choroidal detachment in the affected quadrant. The patient was periodically followed. Three weeks after presentation, the pupil was pharmacologically dilated, vitritis dramatically reduced, and vision improved to 20/20. The conjunctival congestion was reduced. IOP was 18 mmHg. Fundus examination revealed minimal vitritis overlying the affected quadrant with an underlying area of chorioretinal pigmentation (Figure 3  (Fig. 3) ). Optic disc hyperaemia was resolved. The retina was attached throughout and no obvious retinal break could be made out. Global electroretinogram (ERG) revealed reduced scotopic response and depressed oscillatory potentials in the right eye (Figure 4  (Fig. 4) ), even though the photopic response amplitude was normal. Additionally, the trace array on multifocal ERG revealed intact ring responses (Figure 5  (Fig. 5) ). Microperimetry (Figure 6  (Fig. 6) ) revealed a normal retinal sensitivity without any scotoma. Clinical interpretation suggested a diffuse retinal damage to the outer retina (reduced scotopic response) and preserved inner retinal function (normal photopic response) with sparing of macular function (normal trace array on mfERG). Two months later, after discontinuation of all medications, a traumatic mydriasis with sluggish pupillary reaction to direct light reflex was noted. Fundus examination revealed the retina attached throughout with localised chorioretinal pigmentary changes in the affected quadrant and overlying vitreous condensation. The patient was periodically followed up and the pupillary size and reaction improved with time. At the last follow-up, 16 months following presentation, the fundus remained stable. The pupil was sluggishly reactive to direct light reflex and RAPD was noted to be absent.
