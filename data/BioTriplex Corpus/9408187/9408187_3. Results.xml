3.1. Health Questionnaire
No statistically significant differences were observed at T0 between CG (14 ± 3.8), TG1 (15.2 ± 4.3), and TG2 (16.3 ± 2.8).
No statistically significant variances were observed comparing CG (11.2 ± 4), TG1 (10 ± 3.5) at T1. Instead, statistically significant differences were observed between CG and TG2 (8.3 ± 3.7) (BH:  p  < 0.05). Statistically significant variances were observed between TG1 and TG2 at T1 (BH:  p  < 0.05).
Statistically significant variances were observed at T2 ( p  < 0.0001) between CG (9.1 ± 4.6) and TG1 (6 ± 3.1) (BH:  p  < 0.01) and TG2 (BH:  p  < 0.01) (3 ± 3.5). Statistically significant variances were observed at T2 between TG1 and TG2 (BH:  p  < 0.01) ( Figure 1 ).
3.2. Otoscopy
Statistically significant differences (ANOVA:  p  < 0.05) were observed at T0 between CG (2 ± 0.9) and TG1 (3 ± 1.3) and TG2 (3.9 ± 1.4).
A statistically significant difference was observed between CG (1.6 ± 0.9) and TG1 (2.1 ± 1.7) and TG2 (4.1 ± 1.4) at T1 (ANOVA:  p  < 0.01; BH:  p  = 0.003). No statistically significant differences were identified between TG1 and TG2 (BH:  p  >0.05).
At T2 statistically significant differences were observed between CG (2 ± 0.9) and TG1 (2.8 ± 1.5) and TG2 at T1 (ANOVA:  p  < 0.0001); in particular, the differences were between CG and TG2 (4.1 ± 0.3) (BH:  p  < 0.00001) and CG and TG1 (BH:  p  = 0.03) ( Figure 2 ).
3.3. Impedance
No statistically significant differences were observed between CG (2 ± 0) and TG1 (1.9 ± 0.3) and TG2 (1.9 ± 0.3) at T0 (ANOVA:  p  > 0.05). A statistically significant difference was observed between CG (1.7 ± 0.5) and TG1 (1.6 ± 0.5) and TG2 (1.4 ± 0.5) at T1 (ANOVA:  p  < 0.01; BH:  p  = 0.01). No statistically significant differences were noticed between TG1 and TG2.
At T2 a statistically significant difference was observed between CG (1.5 ± 0.5) and TG1 (1.1 ± 1.1) and TG2 (1.1 ± 0.3) at T1 (ANOVA:  p  < 0.0001); in particular, the differences were between CG and TG2 (BH:  p  < 0.00001) and CG and TG1 (BH:  p  = 0.04) ( Figure 3 ).
3.4. Fibroendoscopy
No statistically significant differences were observed between CG (3.1 ± 0.7) and TG1 (2.6 ± 0.6) and TG2 (2.6 ± 0.7) at T0 (ANOVA:  p  >0.05). A statistically significant difference was observed between CG (2.7 ± 0.6) and TG1 (2.3 ± 0.7) and TG2 (1.9 ± 0.8) at T1 (ANOVA:  p < 0.0001; BH:  p  = 0.002). No statistically significant differences were observed between TG1 and TG2 (BH:  p  > 0.05).
At T2 statistically significant differences were found between CG (2.7 ± 0.5) and TG1 (1.9 ± 0.6) and TG2 (1.3 ± 0.6) at T2 (ANOVA:  p  < 0.0001), between CG and TG2 (BH:  p  < 0.00001) and CG and TG1 (BH:  p  = 0.02) ( Figure 4 ).
3.5. Audiometry
No statistically significant differences were identified at T0 between CG (32.6 ± 4.2), TG1 (32.8 ± 9) and TG2 (34.3 ± 10.8) (ANOVA:  p  > 0.05).
No Statistically significant differences were observed at T1 between CG (29.1 ± 4.3) and TG1 (25.9 ± 6.1) and TG2 (23.5 ± 10.9) (BH:  p  > 0.05). Statistically significant differences were identified at T2 ( p  < 0.001) between CG (26.6 ± 5.4) and TG1 (18 ± 5.5) (BH:  p  < 0.05) and CG and TG2 (15 ± 10) (BH:  p  < 0.01) ( Figure 5 ).
A total of 120 children were included in the study: 40 were in the control group (CG) (18 female and 22 male, age average in months 52.1 ± 15.3), 40 in the treatment group 1 (TG1) (22 female and 18 male, age average in months 47.2 ± 15.7), and 40 in the treatment group 2 (TG2) (26 female and 14 male, age average in months 51.1 ± 17.5). None of the patients included in the study needed to use antibiotics during the follow-up period ( Table 2 ).
