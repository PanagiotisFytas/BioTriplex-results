Overall, our study showed that, compared to the traditional therapy alone, the addition to the standard therapy of a supplement with Boswellia serrata, bromelain, magnesium, zinc, honey, and the mixture of the two tyndallized Lactobacillus allowed better recovery from the upper respiratory inflammation and middle-ear-related problems, with a positive impact on patients’ wellness (Powell’s questionnaire). The supplement, despite initial efficacy after 20 days of use, reached the best of its efficacy after 35 days, as shown by the improvement of the auditory test from T0 to T2.
The use of treatment for only 20 days, although able to improve the score of fibroscopy and impedance, was not sufficient for observing clinical differences in the otoscopy findings. Extending the time of the use of the supplement allowed to ameliorate all investigated findings.
We observed the improvement of the health conditions (results of Powell‘s health questionnaire) in all children treated with the supplement. Patients improved their wellness compared to CG after 35 days (T2), independently from the extension (TG2) or not (TG1) of the use of it. This data can be interpreted as: (i) persistence of the efficacy of the supplement after withdrawal or (ii) supplement placebo effect with benefit on the patient’s wellness.
Nutraceuticals can reduce the duration of upper respiratory tract infection [ 10 ]. Della Volpe et al. evaluated the efficacy of a supplement with anti-bacterial, immunomodulating and immunostimulant molecules to ameliorate symptomatology and the clinical course of chronic Otitis Media. The authors concluded that the combination of the molecules acted at different levels, reducing the volume of adenoid tissue, improving the middle ear ventilation, and reducing the recurrence of nasal infections [ 6 ].
Although we used a different supplement, our study confirmed della Volpe et al.’s results. In fact, all patients who used the supplement presented substantial improvement of the measured outcomes (otoscopy, impedance, fibro-endoscopy, and PTA) at T2 (35 days) compared with CG. The best results were obtained after 35 days of using the nutraceutical, as shown by the improvement of the scores of each analyzed variable. Particularly, at T2, TG2 children completely resolved their OME with recovery of normal TM finding, normal tympanogram, and recovery of normal hearing thresholds with complete closure of their air-bone gap (indicative of CHL). We speculate that the improvement of the auditory outcomes was probably related to the reduction of adenoids volume as indicated by the good patency of the rhinopharynx.
However, it is important to underline that after 20 days the anti-inflammatory proprieties of the supplement allowed the improvement of fibroscopy and impedance findings. Anyway, this efficacy was not strong enough to improve the otoscopy aspect of the TM; we speculate that more time would be necessary to observe a clinical change clinically detectable by the specialist.
A study from Cardenas et al. [ 11 ] showed how the use of Lactobacillus salivarius PS7, which has a strong antagonism against otopathogens, was effective in preventing OM; in fact, the number of OM episodes during the intervention period decreased significantly (84%) when compared to the ones reported during the six-months period before the probiotic intervention. On the other hand, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed by Cohen et al. [ 12 ] demonstrated that the use of probiotics or probiotics did not reduce the risk of AOM or recurrent OM, antibiotic use, or lower respiratory tract infections at 1 year.
In this current study we used Flogostop ®  Duo which contains Boswellia serrata, bromelain, magnesium, zinc, tyndallized Lactobacillus (acidophilus and casei), and honey. Each of these elements differently acted on the inflammation which affected the upper-respiratory tract. Boswellia serrata has been used for treating chronic inflammatory diseases for centuries since it contains a series of elements (monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, tetracyclic triterpenic acids, and four major pentacyclic triterpenic acids, i.e., β-boswellic acid, acetyl-β-boswellic acid, 11-keto-β-boswellic acid, and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid) that inhibit pro-inflammatory enzymes. In particular, the acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid is a powerful inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme that modulates inflammation [ 13 ]. Because of these important anti-inflammatory proprieties, Boswellia serrata is commonly used for the treatment of chronic persistent inflammatory disorders [ 14 ]. As additional, Boswellia has the same anti-inflammatory and analgesic capacities of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) without side-effects on the gastrointestinal system [ 15 ]; because these characteristics the supplement with Boswellia should be perfect for treating chronic and recurrent infection/inflammation in children.
Bromelain has anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties that support the effect of Boswellia increasing its anti-inflammatory capacities; the anti-viral effect of Bromelain ulteriorly reduces the inflammation, even stopping the viral diffusion [ 16 ].
Magnesium and zinc have both anti-inflammatory effects. Zinc has antioxidant proprieties [ 17 ] that help to reduce the concentration of reacting oxidative species (ROS); ROS contribute to the increase of inflammation and tissues damage [ 18 ] and their reduction is helpful to rapidly solve infection and inflammation. Honey [ 19 ] and tyndallized Lactobacillus [ 19 ] improve the systemic immune response acting on the gut flora and preserving the intestinal balance.
In our study, Flogostop ®  Duo, which combines these elements, improved the local condition in the upper respiratory tract (reduction of inflammation and viral spread) and the systemic immune response (improvement of white cells action and response, reduction of ROS). Moreover, Boswellia serrata, thanks to its painkiller activity, improved the quality of life of patients without negative effects.
Limitations of the study: this study presents some limitations. As first patients in TG2 started with worsen baseline otoscopic findings than the other two groups (CG and TG1). As second, score 1 (return to normal) might be predictable in all groups. Then, we did not evaluate socio-economical differences. Finally, Powell questionnaire is a self-reported method of data collection and, although asked by a physician during the clinical consultation, it had the biases common to all these types of questionnaires.
