This study confirmed the efficacy of nutraceutical as supporting therapy both for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection and OME in children. In particular, the supplement (Flogostop  ®  Duo) with Boswellia serrata and bromelain (molecules with strong anti-inflammatory and pain-control capacities) could offer the same benefit of NSAID without their adverse effects (i.e., gastric pain). We observed that the treatment had a statistically significant efficacy after 20 days of use, reaching its best efficacy after 35 days. Thanks to the lack of toxicity of the nutraceutical, it was possible to prolong the therapy. Zinc, magnesium, honey, and tyndallized Lactobacillus (acidophilus and casei) continued to improve the efficacy of Flogostop ®  Duo by reducing the inflammation, and improving the local and systemic immune response. Based on our results, we think that the use of this supplement should be considered as adjuvant treatment for the infection of the UTI and OME in children; Flogostop ®  Duo allows to fight the infection/inflammation and to control pain by reducing the use of NSAID.
Additional studies on a larger sample and comparing different types of nutraceuticals should be performed to confirm our results.
Clear guidelines as to the use of nutraceuticals should be defined, even considering that these elements are helpful without being harmful.
