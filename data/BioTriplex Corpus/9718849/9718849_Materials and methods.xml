Animals
FGR model was established by intraperitoneal injection of dexamethasone during perinatal period. On the 14.5th day, the success thrombus test was calculated as 0.5 day. 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone was injected intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days. In this study, 3-month-old offspring male mice were used for behavioral tests. Five mice were fed in each cage, and there was sufficient water and feed in the mouse cage. The feeding environment was set with lighting time from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm every day, and the lights were turned off at other time. After the operation, mice were raised separately in the same environment. All mice were raised separately according to their sex, age and species. 6–9 mice were included in each group for the sake of animal death during behavior tests and stereotactic injection. All animals that participate in the experiment were included for analysis, unless animal death. There was no randomization used in our study. All animal treatment processes were recognized by the animal management and use association of Tongji University.
Behavior
All behavioral experiments were conducted in the light environment from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm. Mice were permitted to rest for 2 weeks between different behavioral tests. Up to four behavioral tests were performed in a batch of mice.
Locomotor activity
The locomotor activity test was performed as previously described [ 59 ]. The open-field test was carried out in a computer-operated detecting and analysis apparatus (Med Associates). Each mouse was placed in the field of 27.31 × 27.31 cm ( L  ×  W ) with a dimly lit background for 30 min of spontaneous exploration. Average velocity and total distance traveled in the whole arena were recorded in this test.
Three-chamber social interaction test
Sociability and social novelty tests were performed as previously described [ 60 ]. Sociability and social novelty were analyzed in an arena (60 × 60 cm) with two equidistant clear Plexiglas cylinders (each 7 cm in diameter, 12 cm tall). The cylinders had multiple holes (1 cm in diameter) to allow the auditory, visual and olfactory interaction between the stimulus mouse placed inside and the test mouse outside of the cylinder. Between trials, the apparatus and cylinders were cleaned with 75% ethanol and dried before testing the next mouse. Time sniffing the social and non-social cylinders was operationally defined as the time during which the test mouse made direct nose-to-cylinder contact with the social and non-social cylinders, respectively. This was captured and recorded with Sony digital video camera mounted above the chamber. The paradigm consisted in a three-stage procedure: During habituation phase, the testing mouse was allowed to initially explore the apparatus with the cylinders for 10 min. In social approaching phase, an unfamiliar sex-matched mouse was placed in one of the cylinder, maintaining the other empty. Finally, in social novelty test, another unfamiliar mouse was introduced to the other empty cylinder. In the preference for social novelty test, preference score was calculated by subtracting the time spent sniffing the two stranger mice.
Nest building test
Nest building test was performed as previously described [ 61 ]. To test nest building ability of mice, one square piece of nesting material made of cotton fiber (5 × 5 cm) was introduced to a cage in which mouse was individually housed. Pictures of the nests were taken 24 h later with a Sony digital video camera. The quality of the nest was assessed using the following score criteria: 1_nestlet not noticeable touched, 2_nestlet partially torn up, 3_ mostly shredded but not identifiable nest site, 4_an identifiable but flat nest, 5_ a well-defined nest with walls.
Prepulse inhibition (PPI) test
PPI test was performed as previously described [ 62 ], with minor modifications. Experiments were performed with sound attenuating test chambers (65 × 35 × 25 cm,  L  ×  W  ×  H ). Each chamber was equipped with a commercial startle reflex system (SR Lab). Each test session began with a 5 min acclimation period in the presence of 50 dB acoustic background noise followed by twelve 100 dB startle pulse (20 ms). In the subsequent 48 trails, the startle tone was either presented alone or after three levels of prepulse intensity (65, 72 and 83 dB, 20 ms) with a delay of 100 ms in a randomized order. The average inter trial between each trial was 30 s (range: 20–40 s). The average startle amplitude during the 100 ms following the onset of each startle stimulus was automatically recorded. Percentage of prepulse inhibition was calculated for each mouse at each prepulse stimulus intensity using the equation: PPI = 100 − [(prepulse/startle alone) × 100], where prepulse is the average startle response on trials in which there was a prepulse stimulus and startle alone is the average startle response on the trials in which the only startle stimulus was presented (excluding the first 12 trials of the session).
Morris water maze
To assess spatial learning and memory, Morris water maze test was performed as described previously [ 63 ]. The Morris water maze was conducted in a circular pool (diameter, 120 cm). Tempera paint was added into the water until it became opaque. And a hidden platform (diameter, 10 cm) was placed 1.0 cm below the water. The water temperature was kept at ±1 °C from 22 °C. Distinct visual cues were hung on the privacy blinds. Mice were monitored using the Ethovision XT (Noldus Information Technology) video tracking system above the water tank and parameters were measured using Ethovision software. Mice were randomly put into the water from four learning positions and swam freely for 1 min. Mice were forced to stand on the platform for 20 s if they did not find and stand on the platform within 1 min. The trial was repeated four times for each mouse during each day of training. Three days of training were performed and a probe trial was conducted on the fourth day.
Lenti virus preparation and stereotactic injection
Lv-plko was constructed in our lab. shNRG1 was driven by U6 promoter. All viruses were titered at about 1.0 × 10 8  TU /ml. All viruses were stored at −80 °C, and used within 3 months. The sequences targeting NRG1 (GenBank Accession: NM-178591) that were used in the experiments were as follows: shCtrl: 5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′, shNRG1: 5′-GCAAACTGCTCCTAAACTT-3′. 293-FT cells were purchased from ATCC(IM-H053), and were recently tested for mycoplasma contamination.
Before stereotactic injection, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1.25% phenobarbital for anesthesia. After that, the mouse head was fixed, the syringe was fixed, and the injection speed of the syringe was adjusted to 0.2 μl/min. The virus was injected at mPFC (anteroposterior (AP) + 1.9 mm, mediolateral (ML) + 0.4 mm, dorsoventral (DV, relative to dura −2.5 mm). About 0.2 μl virus solution was injected to each mPFC region in two hemispheres of mouse brain. After injection, waiting for 10 min before taking out the needle (to prevent liquid leakage). The mouse scalp was sutured and the mouse was placed on the heater until it awoke. Mice were fed separately for one week after virus injection, and then 5 mice were fed in a cage after the wound was completely healed.
Western blot
Approximately 25 μg total protein was loaded per lane, which was then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to the membrane. The sealing solution is 1×TBST solution containing 3% BSA. Sealing at room temperature for 1 h. 1×TBST solution containing primary antibody was added and incubated on a shaking table at 4 °C overnight. Then, the membrane was washed with 1×TBST on a shaking table at room temperature for 5 min each time, 3 times. After that, 1×TBST solution containing secondary antibody was added and incubated on a shaking table at 4 °C for 2 h. Then the membrane was washed with 1×TBST on a shaking table at room temperature for 5 min each time, 3 times. The primary antibodies used for immunostaining were: rabbit anti-PV (1:1,000, Swant, PV27), mouse anti-NRG1(1:1,000, Santa Cruze, sc-393006), rabbit anti-GAD1(1:1,000, Millipore, MAB5406), rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:3,000, Bioworld, AP0013), rabbit anti-β-Tubulin (1:3,000, Invitrogen, 18-0093). The secondary antibodies used for immunostaining were: mouse HRP (1:3,000, Cell Signaling Technology, 7076 s), rabbit HRP (1:3,000, Cell Signaling Technology, 7074 s).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with SYBR-Green-based reagents (Invitrogen) using a CFX96 real-time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad). The total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) using a homogenizer according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The relative quantities of DNA fragments were calculated using the comparative CT method. The results were compared to a standard curve generated by serial dilutions of input DNA. Primers sequences were: ATCAAGAAGGCGATAGGAGCC and GGCCAGAAGCGTCTTTGTT for PV; CACAGGTCACCCTCGATTTTT and ACCATCCAACGATCTCTCTCATC for GAD1; TCCGGCTTTTGGTCCTTCG and ATGCCGCCCGTGAACTTTT for GAD2; ACCGGGAAACAGGAACTGG and TTGCTGGGTTCGAGTTGGC for SST; AGTACACCCAGACCATACTACG and GGCCAAGGACATGACACTCTT for CR; ACCAGCCATCTCATAAAGTGCG and GGCCAAGGACATGACACTCTT for NRG1; GTGCTATGGACCCTACGTTAGT and TCATTGAAGTTCATGCAGGCAA for ErbB4.
Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry analysis
Mice were anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with 20 ml of 1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Hippocampal tissue was stored in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 8 h then switched to 30% sucrose solution for an additional 48 h in preparation for brain sectioning. Serial coronal 40 µm sections of the hippocampus and mPFC (+1.8 mm to +1.95 mm from bregma) were collected using a freezing microtome (Leica, SM2010R) and stored in cryoprotective medium (40% PBS, 30% glycerol and 30% ethylene glycol) at −20 °C until immunostaining. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed using standard techniques using free-floating sections. The primary antibody used for immunostaining was: rabbit anti-PV (1:5,000, Swant, PV27). All fluorescent secondary antibodies were diluted at a concentration of 1:1,000 and incubated with sections for 2 h at 4 °C. The fluorescent secondary antibody used for immunostaining was (1:1,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nuclei was fluorescently labeled with Hoechst 33342 (1:2,000, Sigma-Aldrich, B2261). For quantification, overlapping images of mPFC and different regions of hippocampus on each section were captured by confocal microscopy in z stack. The density of PV interneurons was determined by dividing the total number of PV interneurons by the corresponding volume of mPFC or hippocampal regions.
Statistics
All statistical data are from the results of more than three repeated experiments. The data shown in the figure is the mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD). One way ANOVA analysis or two way ANOVA analysis is used for statistics. If  P  < 0.05, it is considered to have statistical difference, it is represented by ‘*’; If  P  < 0.01, it is indicated by ‘**’; If  P  < 0.001, it is indicated by ‘***’.
Blind statement
The investigator was blinded to the group allocation during the experiment and/or when assessing the outcome.
