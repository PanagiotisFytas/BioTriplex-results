FGR leads to schizophrenia behavioral defects
FGR is mainly caused by abnormal uterine function. In this study, pregnant mice were intraperitoneally injected of dexamethasone to induce uterine function impairment. FGR neonatal mice showed significantly decreased body weight, brain weight, and crown-rump length (Fig.  1a–c ). A series of schizophrenia related behavioral tests were carried out, including locomotor activity test, social behavior tests, cognitive behavior test and sensory motor gating test. In locomotor activity, the total distance was significantly increased FGR mice, while the average speed was comparable between two groups (Fig.  1d, e ). Social proximity and social novelty were mainly detected by three chamber social behavior test (Fig.  1f, g ). In social approaching stage, both FGR and control mice showed considerable sociability (Fig.  1f ). In social novelty stage, when the second stranger mouse was introduced, the exploration time of FGR mice to the second stranger mouse was significantly reduced compared with control mice (Fig.  1g ). In nesting experiment, control mice completed the nesting task within 24 h, while FGR mice showed poor performance in this task (Fig.  1h ). The nesting score of FGR mice was significantly reduced compared with control mice (Fig.  1i ). Three chamber behavior test and nesting experiment results showed that the sociability was significantly impaired in FGR mice. Then, we tested the cognition of FGR and control mice, as schizophrenic patients showed significant decline in learning and memory. FGR led to significant defects in spatial learning and 24 h short-term memory in Morris water maze (Fig.  1j, k ). Prepulse inhibitory is a classical test in evaluating the sensory gating function in schizophrenia research. Results showed that the PPI of control mice increased gradually as the elevation of pre-stimulation, while the PPI was significantly reduced in FGR mice, which indicated profound sensory gating defects in FGR mice (Fig.  1l ). All the above behavioral test results indicate that FGR leads to schizophrenia behavioral defects.

FGR results in mPFC PV interneuron GABAergic maturation defects
PV interneuron dysfunction plays a critical role in schizophrenia progression [ 41 ,  42 ]. We detected the maturation of PV interneuron in hippocampus and mPFC regions of FGR and control mice. QPCR results showed that the mRNA levels of PV and GAD1 were significantly decreased in mPFC of FGR mice, while GAD2 were comparable in FGR and control groups (Fig.  2a, b ). And the mRNA levels of SST and CR, another two important interneuron marker genes, were comparable between FGR and control mice hippocampus and mPFC (Fig.  2a, b ). Western blot results indicated that the protein levels of PV and GAD1 of FGR mice mPFC region decreased significantly (Fig.  2c, d  and whole membrane image 1), while these were comparable in hippocampus (Fig.  2e, f  and whole membrane image 2). Meanwhile, immunostaining results also proved that the percentage and density of PV interneurons were significantly decreased in mPFC of FGR mice (Fig.  2g, h ), while these were comparable in hippocampal DG, CA1 and CA3 regions between FGR and control mice (Supplementary Fig.  1 ). The above results indicated that the GABAergic maturation of PV interneurons was significantly impaired in the mPFC region of FGR mice.

FGR leads to upregulation of NRG1 in mPFC
NRG1 is fundamental in schizophrenia progression [ 35 ,  36 ], and was found significantly upregulated in the brain of schizophrenic patients [ 37 – 39 ]. In this study, we found that the mRNA level of Nrg1 was increased in mPFC of FGR mice (Fig.  3a ), while the mRNA levels of ErbB4, Disc1, Grin1 and Dtnbp1 were comparable in both mPFC and hippocampus between two groups(Fig.  3a, b ). Western blot results also indicated that the expression of NRG1 protein increased significantly in mPFC of FGR mice (Fig.  3c, d  and whole membrane image 3), while no significant change was observed in hippocampus (Fig.  3e, f  and whole membrane image 4).

Moreover, the postnatal dynamic mRNA and protein expression of PV and NRG1 were assessed during P0-P60. FGR and control mice were sacrificed at 0, 7, 30 and 60 days after birth. Their hippocampus and mPFC were extracted to detect the mRNA and protein level of PV and NRG1. The mRNA level of PV in the mPFC of FGR mice was significantly decreased from the 30th day after birth compared with control group (Supplementary Fig.  2a ). While in hippocampus, the mRNA level of PV was comparable between two groups (Supplementary Fig.  2b ). The protein level of PV in both mPFC and hippocampus of FGR mice was significantly lower than control mice from the 30th day after birth (Supplementary Fig.  2e, f  and whole membrane image 5, 6). Besides, in FGR mice mPFC, the mRNA and protein level of NRG1 increased significantly from the 7th day after birth (Supplementary Fig.  2c, e , and whole membrane image 5). While in hippocampus, the level of NRG1 was comparable between two groups (Supplementary Fig.  2d, f , and whole membrane image 6). Hence, we made an assumption that the significant upregulation of NRG1 in FGR mice mPFC may be one main cause of schizophrenia behavior induced by FGR.
NRG1 knockdown improves FGR PV interneurons GABAergic maturation
To verify the importance of high mPFC NRG1 level in FGR induced schizophrenia progression, we constructed a shNRG1 lenti-virus. shNRG1 was driven by U6. One week after we injected the virus into the mPFC of mice, the mPFC was extracted to detect the mRNA level of Nrg1. QPCR results showed that Nrg1 was significantly knockdown in shNRG1 group (Fig.  4a ). Western blot results also indicated that the protein level of NRG1 was significantly reduced in shNRG1 mouse group (Fig.  4b, c  and whole membrane image 7). Then, we stereotactically injected shNRG1 lenti-virus or shCtrl lenti-virus to the mPFC of control and FGR mice. One week after injection, the mRNA level of PV and GAD1was detected. QPCR results showed that, the mRNA level of PV and GAD1 were significantly upregulated in FGR mice mPFC (Fig.  4d, e ). Western blot results showed that, the protein level of PV and GAD1 were also significantly upregulated in FGR mice mPFC (Fig.  4f, g  and whole membrane image 8). Moreover, immunostaining of PV in the mPFC region showed that the percentage and density of PV interneurons increased significantly in FGR-shNRG1 group compared with FGR-shCtrl mice (Fig.  4h, i ). These results proved that NRG1 knockdown in mPFC improved the PV interneuron GABAergic maturation of FGR mice.

NRG1 mPFC knockdown rescues FGR induced schizophrenia behavior
One week after lenti-virus mPFC stereotactic injection, we performed a variety of schizophrenia behavioral tests. Results showed that mPFC NRG1 knockdown significantly reduced the total distance of locomotor activity in FGR mice group, while the average speed was not affected (Fig.  5a, b ). In addition, in three chamber social behavior test, the sociability of four groups of mice was not altered in social approaching stage, while in social novelty stage, the communication and exploration time with stranger mice was significantly upregulated after mPFC NRG1 knockdown in FGR mice (Fig.  5c, d ). Meanwhile, mPFC NRG1 knockdown also significantly improved the nesting score of FGR mice (Fig.  5e, f ). These two behavior tests showed that mPFC NRG1 knockdown rescued the social defects in FGR mice. Besides, Morris water maze results showed that mPFC NRG1 knockdown significantly improved the spatial learning and 24 h short-term memory of FGR mice (Fig.  5g, h ). Finally, the prepulse inhibition test results showed that mPFC NRG1 knockdown significantly upregulated the PPI and rescued the sensorimotor gating function of FGR mice (Fig.  5i ). Meanwhile, the PPI of control mice was not altered after mPFC NRG1 knockdown. Collectively, these results indicated that mPFC NRG1 knockdown rescued schizophrenia behaviors in FGR mice.
