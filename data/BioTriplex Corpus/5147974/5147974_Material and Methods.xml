Animals and samples collection
Six-week-old male apolipoprotein-E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice (strain C57BL/6J; Animal Center of Peking University, Beijing, China, Permit Number: SCXK2002-001) were divided into 3 groups (n = 10 each) as following: (1) Hyperlipidemia (HLP) group: mice were fed standard mouse diet containing 0% cholesterol, 5.23% fat, 0.37% methionine, 2.39 mg/g choline, 3.19 mg/kg folate, 54.6 μg/kg B12 and 14.5 mg/kg B6; (2) HHcy group: mice were fed standard mouse diet plus 1.7% methionine; (3) HHcy+folate+vitamin B12 (HHcy+FA+VB) group: mice were fed standard mouse diet with 1.7% methionine, folate and vitamin B12 supplements. The control group (CON) consisted of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice fed with a regular mouse diet. The animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room (22–25°C, 45% humidity) with a 12 h dark-light cycle for 16 weeks. All the animal experiments conformed to the Animal Management Guidelines of the People’s Republic of China. The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care Ethics Committee of the Ningxia Medical University.
The mice were sacrificed after 16 weeks, and blood was withdrawn in a fasted state from the orbital sinus of anesthetized animals. Serum was then isolated from the blood, and the levels of Hcy and lipid profiles, including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL), were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Automatic Biochemical Analyzer (SIEMENS, Munich, Germany), respectively. The thoracic aorta was isolated from the mice for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) as well as Oil Red O staining. The plaqe area was quantified using the Histolab software (Microvisions, Paris, France). At the end of the experimental protocol, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and thoracic aorta were rapidly excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and Oil Red O staining
Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin using standard procedures. Aortic tissues from ApoE-/- and WT mice were placed in OCT (VWR Scientific, St. Louis, MO), and rapidly frozen for sections. The thoracic aortasections (4 μm thick) were cut and stained with HE (Bi Yuntian, Shanghai, China) for standard microscopy.
For Oil Red O staining, sections were fixed in 10% formalin for 1 h, and rinsed 3 times with ddH 2 O. Sections were dehydrated for 5 min in 100% isopropanol, stained with filtered Oil Red O (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) working solution (60% Oil Red O stock solution/40% water) for 1 h at room temperature, and then rinsed in ddH 2 O for 5 min. The sections were observed under the inverted microscope and the images were captured using BD2000 microscopic image analysis system (Qihang, Beijing, China).
Cell treatment and transfection
Human THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, was maintained in RPMI-1640 (GIBCO, California, USA) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/ mL streptomycin (GIBCO) in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . Cells were routinely passaged at 2–3 day intervals. To demonstrate the effect of Hcy on lipogenesis, cells were initially differentiated into macrophages by adding 5 μM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) for 48 h. Thereafter, macrophages were transformed into foam cells by incubation with 50 mg/L oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) in medium containing 100 μM Hcy or supplemented with its antagonist. Total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were analyzed by Cholesterol Quantitation Kit (Catalogue No. K603-100, Biovision, Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA). For transfection experiments, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates, incubated overnight, and then transfected with Ad-EZH2, Ad-EZH2-siRNAs or Ad-GFP (GENECHEM, Shanghai, China) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from the aorta tissue and foam cells using RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA samples were accurately quantified using Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen), and immediately converted into cDNA using the reverse transcription kit (Takara, Dalian, China). The cDNA was amplified by PCR in a real time cycler using FastStart SYBR Green master mix (MBI, Vilnius, Lithuania) and primers for EZH2 and β-actin (Shenggong, Shanghai, China). The primers we used as follow. Human EZH2 primers: positive-sense: 5’- CATTCGGTAAATCCAAACTGC -3’, anti-sense: 5’- CGACATACTTCAGGGCATCA -3’. Mouse EZH2 primer: positive-sense: 5’- GTATGACTGCTTCCTACATCCCTTC -3’, anti-sense: 5’- CTGGGCGTTTAGGTGGTGTCT-3’. The primers of β-actin were synthetise by commercial company (Shenggong, Shanghai, China). The SYBR Green PCR cycle was set as following: initial denaturation cycle for 10 min at 95°C, 45 cycles consisting of 30 s of denaturation at 95°C, 30 s annealing at primer-specific temperatures, and extension at 72°C. All the experiments were performed in triplicates, and the data were normalized using β-actin as the house-keeping gene, and expressed as mean ± SD.
Western blot analysis
The protein was extracted from the aorta tissue and foam cells in lysis buffer containing the protease inhibitor cocktail (Biyuntian, Shanghai, China). Western blot analysis was performed as we described previously [ 5 ]. In brief, protein concentration was quantified using the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and 20 μg of protein extracts were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE for electrophoresis. The protein was then transferred onto a PVDF-membrane (Millipore, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) using a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, California, USA), and blocked overnight using 5% nonfat dry milk and Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membrane was incubated with anti-EZH2, H3K27me1,2,3 monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti-β-actin antibody (1:1000 dilution; Zhongshan Biotech, Beijing, China) followed by HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Protein was then detected using the chemiluminescence kit (Biyuntian, Shanghai, China). All samples were derived at the same time and processed in parallel.
Immunofluorescence staining of adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP)
First, cells in slides were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, then refrigerated in PBS until further use. Immediately prior to staining, the cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 10% goat serum for 5 min, and then incubated with anti-ADRP antibody (1:200 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) overnight at 4°C. Next day, the cells were washed with PBS, incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) for 1 h at 37°C, followed by washing with PBS for three times, and the nuclei were then counterstained with 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Bound antibodies were viewed under a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview 1000, Japan).
Vector construction of Lv-miR-92a
miR-92a pri-miR sequences were amplified and the amplified PCR product was cloned into hU6-MCS-PGK-EGFP vector (LV-miR-92a)(Hanbio, Shanghai, China). Empty lentiviral vector was used as the negative control. Design the antagonism of miR-92a and cloned the sequences into lentiviral vector (LV-miR-92a-antago). The sequence of antagonism is GACAGGCCGGGACAAGTGCAATATTTTTTc. LV-miR-92a and LV-miR-92a-antago were transfected into THP-1 cells to screen stable cell lines by puromycin.
Luciferase reporter assay
Through TargetScan, a bioinformatics prediction program that can identify hypothetical mRNA-binding-specific miRNA, we identified EZH2 as a potential target of miR-92a. Genomic DNA extracted from THP-1 cells was used as a template to amplify a fragment of the 3’-UTR of EZH2, which contains the putative miR-92a-binding sequence. The amplified PCR product was cloned into PmirGLO dual fluorescent reporter system vectorvector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The miR-92a binding site within the EZH2 3’UTR was mutated using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. A control reporter plasmid with a mutation of 6 nucleotides corresponding to miR-92a seed sequence (ACGUUAU) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The luciferase activity was examined at 48 hour post-transfection using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and a 96-well plate reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). All the experiments were repeated at least 3 times.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.03 Software (San Diego, USA). Data were analyzed for differences between the dietary treatment groups by either One-way ANOVA or unpaired Student's  t -test. Correlation analysis was performed using the Pearson correlation analysis.  P  ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results were expressed as mean ± SD. All the experiments were performed at least 3 times, and representative results were shown.
