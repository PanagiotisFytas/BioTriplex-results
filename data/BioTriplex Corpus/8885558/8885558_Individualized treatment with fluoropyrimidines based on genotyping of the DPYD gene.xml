The current recommendations made by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to prevent any serious adverse events (particularly gastrointestinal, hematological, hand–foot syndrome, etc.) are based on assessing DPD activity in all patients who are candidates for receiving a fluoropyrimidine-based regimen, specifically the initial assessment of the following clinically validated mutations: c.1679T>G ( DPYD *13, p.I560S), c.1905 + 1G>A ( DPYD *2A), c.2846 A>T (p.D949 V), and c.1236 G>A (c.1129–5923 C>G, HapB3). Genotyping allows the classification of individuals as “normal” metabolizers (activity score of 2), “intermediate” metabolizers (activity score of 1–1.5), or “poor” metabolizers (activity score of 0–0.5) (Table  4 ). While the former does not require modifications in the initial dose, the intermediate group should start treatment with a dose reduced to approximately 50% and then escalate the dose in later cycles if no toxicity is observed. For poor metabolizers, the administration of fluoropyrimidines is contraindicated, and other therapeutic options should be considered (Fig.  2 ) [ 48 ,  49 ]. Table 4 Dosing of fluoropyrimidines according to DPD phenotype based on genotype Phenotype Genotype Implications Dosing recommendation Normal metabolizer (Activity score 2) Wild-type (absence of mutation) Normal DPD activity and normal risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity According to the data sheet Intermediate metabolizer (activity score 1–1.5) Wild-type allele and mutated allele (*2A o *13 or c.2846A>T or HapB3) Decreased DPD activity (30–70%) and increased risk for severe or even fatal drug toxicity when treated with fluoropyrimidines Reduce starting dose by 50% followed by titration of dose based on toxicity or pharmacokinetics Two mutated alleles (c.2846A>T or HapB3) Poor metabolizer (Activity score 0–0.5) Two mutated alleles (*2A or *13) Complete or almost complete DPD deficiency and increased risk for severe or even fatal drug toxicity when treated with fluoropyrimidines Contraindicated treatment with fluoropyrimidines; look for alternative agents* One mutated allele (*2A or *13) and one mutated allele (c.2846A>T or HapB3) 5-FU  5-fluorouracil,  CPIC  Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium,  DPD  dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase 1 ] *In the event that alternative agents are not considered a suitable therapeutic option and patient has an activity score of 0,5, CPIC indicates that 5-FU could be administered at a strongly reduced dose (< 25% of the normal dose) with early therapeutic drug monitoring of plasma concentration of 5-FU, to discontinue therapy if the drug level is too high [ Fig. 2 Decision-making algorithm in the administration of fluoropyrimidines in cancer patients. *Dose titration according to the toxicity observed. **Evaluate therapeutic alternatives
The safety of individualized fluoropyrimidine treatment has been proven in several studies. In a prospective Dutch study,  DPYD *2A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T, and c.1236G>A were genotyped in a series of more than 1,100 patients. It was found that prospective genotyping of  DPYD  is feasible in routine clinical practice and that dose reductions based on the results improved patient safety under fluoropyrimidine treatment. In that study, a reduction in the initial dose of 50% was adequate for  DPYD *2A and c.1679T>G carriers, while a 25% dose reduction in c.1236G>A and c.2846A>T carriers was insufficient to reduce the risk of toxicity [ 6 ].
Another question is whether individualization can affect the efficacy of treatment. A cohort study compared the clinical evolution between carriers of the  DPYD *2A variant treated with a 50% dose reduction and native paired controls who were treated with the full dose. The dose reduction did not seem to affect the overall survival of the patients (27 vs. 24 months;  p  = 0.47). However, the study was small, and there are no similar studies that have evaluated the clinical evolution of carriers of the other three variants [ 50 ].
A limitation of individualized treatment based on  DPYD  analysis is that the variants of  DPYD  that have been studied are predictive only in Western or northern European populations. In a recent Spanish study [ 47 ], 28 patients who presented severe toxicity induced by fluoropyrimidines and who were not carriers of the four recommended mutations were studied. They sequenced the full  DPYD  exome and phenotyped DPD by measuring uracilemia (U) and dihydrouracilemia (UH2) and the UH2/U ratio in the plasma. The  DPYD *6 variant (c.2194G>A) was present in an unexpectedly high percentage (32%) of this population, and three of the patients studied did not have  DPYD  coding variants. Those findings suggested that other factors, such as other genes or epigenetic changes, may play important roles.
