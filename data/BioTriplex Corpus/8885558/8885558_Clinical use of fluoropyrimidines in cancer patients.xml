Indications and regimens of fluoropyrimidines
Fluoropyrimidines are essential in the treatment of multiple neoplasms, 5-FU and capecitabine being the most commonly used in solid tumors. The main indications for fluoropyrimidines [ 11 ,  12 ] are (1) colorectal cancer in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, both as monotherapy and in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan; (2) treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer in the neoadjuvant setting associated with radiotherapy; (3) treatment of localized anal canal cancer; (4) treatment of locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal cancer; (5) first-line treatment of metastatic gastric cancer in combination with a regimen that includes platinum, as well as of perioperative or adjuvant gastric cancer; (6) treatment of pancreatic cancer in the adjuvant or metastatic settings; (7) treatment of breast cancer in the adjuvant or metastatic settings; in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, it can be administered as monotherapy after failure of taxanes and an anthracycline regimen or when subsequent treatment with anthracyclines is not indicated; and (8) treatment of inoperable, locally advanced, and recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
5-FU is administered by intravenous injection as a bolus, perfusion, or continuous perfusion for 1–5 days, alone or modulated with leucovorin. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-FU that is administered orally at doses of 800–1250 mg/m 2  body surface area every 12 h. Tegafur is infrequently used today, although it can be used at doses of 500–1000 mg/m 2 /day as part of various chemotherapeutic regimens. Fluoropyrimidines can be administered both as monotherapy and in combination with other antineoplastic agents and monoclonal antibodies. Table  1  summarizes the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens with fluoropyrimidines, classified by tumor type [ 13 ,  14 ].

Toxicity of fluoropyrimidines
In general, fluoropyrimidines are well-tolerated cytostatics with a manageable adverse event profile. However, the toxicity associated with these drugs is a recognized clinical problem that has significant consequences on the quality of life of patients. Approximately, 30% of those who receive 5-FU or capecitabine in monotherapy experience severe toxicity related to the treatment, which in 10–20% of cases may require hospitalization and is lethal in 0.5–1.0% of cases [ 15 – 17 ].
The toxicity profile of fluoropyrimidines varies depending on the administration regimen. With the most common regimen of 5-FU in continuous infusion, diarrhea and mucositis are the main dose-limiting problems, while myelosuppression and subacute palmar–plantar erythrodysaesthesia (hand–foot syndrome) are usually less frequent [ 15 ]. In contrast, an intravenous bolus of 5-FU causes more myelosuppression. With the usual oral regimen of capecitabine administration, the most frequent toxicities that lead to dose reduction or treatment interruption are hand–foot syndrome, diarrhea, and nausea [ 16 ]. Other common toxicities are fatigue, stomatitis, skin hyperpigmentation, photosensitivity, blepharitis, and epiphora. A rare but potentially serious adverse effect is cardiotoxicity associated with treatment with 5-FU or capecitabine. These are cases of angina secondary to coronary vasospasm that can cause myocardial damage, especially in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The angina usually appears at the beginning of treatment and is reversible within a few hours after stopping the administration of the drug. Neurological toxicities, such as neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia, or cognitive impairment, have also been described in fewer than 1% of patients [ 15 ,  16 ].
Advanced age brings a higher risk of serious adverse events, since it is correlated with more comorbidities, worse functional status, and lower creatinine clearance, so a reduction in the initial dose of 20–25% is recommended in the geriatric population and in patients with moderate or severe kidney failure (e.g., creatinine clearance of 30–50 ml/min estimated by Cockroft–Gault formula) [ 18 ]. If creatinine clearance is less than 30 ml/min, capecitabine is contraindicated. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, close monitoring of analytical parameters is recommended without specific dose adjustment recommendations [ 15 – 17 ].
Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics of fluoropyrimidines
5-FU is administered intravenously, while capecitabine and tegafur are prodrugs of 5-FU administered orally. 5-FU has no pharmacological activity but is converted into its active metabolites in the liver [ 19 ]. Only 1–3% of the administered dose of 5-FU is converted into cytotoxic metabolites that produce the antineoplastic effect (Fig.  1 ). More than 80% of 5-FU is converted into dihydrofluorouracil by the DPD enzyme and then into inactive metabolites [ 20 ,  21 ]. The rest of the 5-FU is excreted unmetabolized in the urine. Women show a lower clearance of 5-FU which can predispose them to a higher toxicity due to fluoropyrimidines, although the precise reason is unclear [ 22 ]. Fig. 1 5-FU  5-fluorouracil,  5′dFCR  5′-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine,  5′dFUR  5′-desoxy-5-fluorouridine,  CDA  cytidine deaminase,  CES  carboxylesterases,  CYP2A6  cytochrome P450 2a6,  DHF  dihydrofolate,  DHFU  dihydrofluorouracil,  DPD  dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase,  dTMP  deoxythymidine monophosphate,  dUMP  deoxyuridine monophosphate,  FBAL  α -fluoro-β-alanine,  FdUDP  fluorodeoxyuridine diphosphate,  FdUMP  fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate,  FdUTP  fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate,  FUDP  fluorouridine diphosphate,  FUDR  fluorodeoxyuridine,  FUMP  fluorouridine monophosphate,  FUPA  5-fluoro-ureidopropionic acid,  FUTP  fluorouridine triphosphate,  MTHF  5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate,  TP  thymidine phosphorylase,  TS  thymidylate synthase Metabolism and mechanism of action of fluoropyrimidines. 
The main activation mechanism of 5-FU is conversion to fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate), which inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, blocking the folate cycle and the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, as described in Fig.  1  [ 21 ]. In addition, fluorouridine triphosphate and fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate metabolites can be incorporated into RNA and DNA, respectively, which increases DNA repair mechanisms by base cleavage, leading to DNA fragmentation and cell death [ 21 ].
Capecitabine is absorbed in the intestinal wall and converted into 5′-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine and then into 5′-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5′dFUR) by carboxylesterase and cytidine deaminase, respectively, both in the liver and tumor tissues [ 23 ]. 5′dFUR is converted into 5-FU by thymidine phosphorylase, which is generally more highly expressed in tumor tissues than in normal tissues. Tegafur is another prodrug of 5-FU, which is converted by the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2A6 into an unstable intermediate metabolite, 5-hydroxytegafur, which decomposes spontaneously to form 5-FU [ 2 ] (Fig.  1 ).
Description of the  DPYD  gene
The  DPYD  gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of the catabolism of fluoropyrimidines, DPD, and is approximately 950 kb long. It is located on chromosome 1p21.3 and consists of 23 exons [ 24 ,  25 ]. A multitude of genetic variants have been described that include polymorphisms and mutations that alter the protein sequence or RNA splicing ( https://www.pharmvar.org/gene/DPYD ) and that sometimes affect its enzymatic function. In this way, the high interindividual variability in the activity of DPD is mainly due to polymorphic variants in the  DPYD  gene. It is estimated that 0.01–0.5% of Caucasian individuals have a complete deficiency of the enzyme and 3–8% a partial deficiency. A deficiency in DPD activity is associated with a higher risk of severe toxicity due to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy [ 26 ,  27 ] as a consequence of a lower rate of clearance and a longer half-life of 5-FU [ 28 ].
Recommended  DPYD  gene variants to genotype
The AEMPS recommends genotyping for four  DPYD  variants in patients who are candidates for treatment with dihydropyrimidines (Table  2 ) [ 6 ,  10 ]: (1)  DPYD *2A (rs3918290, c.1905 + 1G>A, IVS14 + 1G>A); (2)  DPYD *13 (rs55886062, c.1679T>G, I560S); (3)  DPYD  c.2846A>T (rs67376798, D949V); and (4)  DPYD  c.1236G>A/HapB3 (rs56038477, E412E, in haplotype B3). These are variants of  DPYD  that lead to a loss of enzymatic function and are found with relatively higher frequency in the population. The  DPYD *2A and  DPYD *13 variants have the greatest impact on the activity of DPD, since it is no longer functional when homozygous; in heterozygous carriers, the reduction of activity is 50% and 68%, respectively, while the variants  DPYD  c.2846A>T and  DPYD  HapB3 cause a reduction of 30% and 35%, respectively, in heterozygous carriers [ 1 ]. Table 2 DPYD  variants Characteristics of the recommended  Allele Level of evidence assigned to allele* Activity score # Level of evidence for dose titration Frequency in Europeans No function DPYD *2A (rs3918290, c.1905 + 1G>A, IVS14 + 1G>A) High 0 1A 1.0–1.2% DPYD *13 (rs55886062, c.1679T>G, I560S) Moderate 0 1A 0.1% Decreased function DPYD  c.2846A>T (rs67376798, D949V) High 0,5 1A 0.8–1.4% DPYD  c.1236G>A/HapB3 (rs56038477, E412E, in haplotype B3) High 0,5 1A 4.1–4.8% Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium  (CPIC) guidelines *Based on  # Based on clinical annotation levels of evidence of PharmGKB
 *2A is located in the intronic region adjacent to exon 14 and causes an in-frame deletion of this entire exon, thus generating a non-functional protein [ 29 ]. The  DPYD *13 and c.2846A>T variants are missense mutations that affect enzyme function [ 30 ,  31 ]. The  DPYD  c.1236G>A polymorphism is in perfect linkage disequilibrium with c.1129-5923C>G (rs75017182) ( r 2  = 1.0;  D ′ = 1.0) [ 32 ,  33 ]. Both define the HapB3 haplotype [ 5 ,  32 ,  33 ]. The  DPYD  c.1129-5923C>G (rs75017182) polymorphism in intron 10 produces a splicing error generating a protein with reduced activity [ 5 ,  32 ]. This SNP is probably the causal variant of the HapB3 haplotype [ 4 ].
In Europeans, the  DPYD  c.1129-5923C>G (HapB3) variant is the most common, with a frequency of 4.1–4.8% [ 1 ], followed by the  DPYD *2A variants (1.0–1.2%) [ 1 ],  DPYD  c.2846A>T (0.8–1.4%) [ 1 ], and  DPYD *13 (0.1%) [ 34 ]. Considering all the variants combined, approximately 7% of the European population carries at least one variant causing loss of function of the DPD enzyme [ 1 ]. Complete deficiency of DPD activity in carriers of two different variants or the same variant in homozygosity is very rare: It is estimated to occur in 0.01–0.50% of Caucasian individuals [ 10 ].
These four variants have been associated with a reduction in DPD activity and a statistically significant increase in the risk of toxicity [ 6 ]. The degree of evidence that supports the influence of each variant on DPD activity is different: for  DPYD *2A,  DPYD  c.2846A>T, and HapB3, the evidence is strong (in vitro and clinical studies), while for  DPYD *13 it is moderate (in vitro and  clinical/ ex vivo studies) [ 1 ].
To aid in the interpretation of the genotyping results and to define the phenotype of the patient, an individual activity score can be assigned to each of these four  DPYD  polymorphisms. Thus, if the alleles were *2A or *13 they would have a score of 0 and c.2846A>T and HapB3 of 0.5. If the allele is wild type, the score would be 1. To assign a global activity score, the sum of the individual scores of the two alleles is calculated. The optimal dose for the patient will depend on the activity calculated for DPD [ 1 ].
PharmGKB establishes different levels of evidence for pharmacogenetic associations with prescription recommendations [ 35 ]. For these four variants, the level of evidence is the highest: 1A. In fact, there are specific prescription guidelines available for these drug–variant pairs [ 36 ].
In the informative note published by AEMPS on May 11, 2020, it is noted that in addition to the four main variants mentioned above, there are rarer variants and other factors that may influence the development of toxicity associated with treatment with dihydropyrimidines [ 10 ]. Still, genotyping these four variants is the most well-established and simplest method [ 10 ].
Determination of other variants of the  DPYD  gene
The four variants described in the previous section are not enough to cover all the activity deficits found for DPD. The gnomAD database currently includes 204 synonymous variants and 569 missense variants in  DPYD,  of which 40 have been related to the loss of enzymatic function [ 37 ]. The latest version of the  Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium  (CPIC) guide has a table of allelic functionality that includes 82 known variants, among which, in addition to the four mentioned in the previous section, 19 are considered to have no function and four to have diminished function [ 38 ]. However, most of these variants with phenotypic consequences are extremely rare and have not even been observed in studies with large cohorts [ 3 ,  39 ,  40 ]. In addition, in most cases, the activity assignment is based on in vitro or ex vivo studies, and the genotype–phenotype relationship has been corroborated in vivo only in a small proportion of cases [ 30 ,  41 ]. Besides the variant c.1905 + 1G>A ( DPYD *2A), other mutations, such as c.2059-22T>G, c.321 + 1G>A, c.1740 + 2T, and c.2242 + 1G>T, produce a functional exon jump with the consequent loss of a part of the protein sequence and sometimes also a change in the open reading frame, generating a non-functional protein [ 42 ,  43 ]. However, the clinical evidence for the relationship of many of these variants with the toxicity of fluoropyrimidines is still limited, and there are no cost-effectiveness studies, which limits their wider incorporation into clinical practice. Among the known inactivating variants, in its guide to methodological recommendations and analytical interpretation, SEFF distinguishes six that it considers supported by a “moderate” level of evidence (Table  3 ) [ 44 ]. Typing these variants would be recommended in centers where the technique is easily accessible, to correctly assign the pharmacogenetic phenotypes of DPD despite their low frequency in the European population.

Techniques to determine  DPYD  gene variants and accreditation of centers
Various techniques can be used to detect genetic variants of  DPYD  whose genotyping is recommended in this consensus of experts (i.e.,  DPYD *2A, *13, c.2846A>T, and HapB3) [ 44 ]. These are methods based on genotyping (selection of SNPs or arrays) or sequencing (Sanger or massive parallel sequencing). Another factor determining the choice of method is the number of genes and variants to be analyzed. Either the  DPYD  variants of interest alone could be typed, or they could be incorporated into a massive pharmacogenetic analysis that provides information on useful variants for other drugs. The fastest, simplest, and most economical way is to analyze the variants by real-time polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]). For this, any type of probe that discriminates a variant can be used, such as LightMix ®  (Roche), TaqMan ®  (Thermo Fisher), KASP ®  (LGC Biosearch Technologies), or rhAmp ®  (Integrated DNA Technologies) [ 45 ,  46 ]. A viable and economical alternative for laboratories that cannot do real-time PCR is to use conventional Sanger sequencing. Methods for the PCR amplification of each of the 23 exons of the  DPYD  gene have been described, so those that would amplify the positions of the four recommended variants can be selected [ 47 ]. Sequencing has the advantage that rare variants present in the sequenced regions can be detected. However, if the appropriate equipment is available, commercial kits such as the Elucigene  DPYD  LightMix in vitro diagnostics kit Multi-SNiP  DPYD  can be used to type the variants of interest.
As for the mass technologies useful for  DPYD  genotyping, custom or commercial SNP panels with thousands of SNPs in multiple genes, massive parallel sequencing, gene panels, exome sequencing, or genome sequencing can be used. All technologies are valid as long as at least the genetic variants recommended in this consensus of experts and its future updates are among those detected by each of these products and technologies.
Regardless of the technique used, it is essential that the laboratory has a recognized certification that supports the genotyping process. For this reason, SEFF launched in 2018 the first proficiency testing for accreditation of laboratories in pharmacogenetics ( https://seff.es/grupo-proficiency-testing/ ). Since then, the second edition of this accreditation has been launched, which covers, among other polymorphisms of pharmacogenetic interest, the four minimum  DPYD  variants recommended for starting treatment with fluoropyrimidines. This accreditation, or a similar one, is necessary, regardless of the technique used. In addition, it is advisable that laboratories have other accreditations that certify the technique, the handling of samples, and the quality of the process, such as ISO 9001, ISO 14000 ISO 725, or ISO 15189. Any report of results must contain at least the following information regarding the genotyping: type of sample, technique used, and polymorphisms analyzed. It is also important to note in the report that the patient may carry rare variants that have not been analyzed but which may affect the phenotype assigned, and in the absence of any variants, it is assumed that the patient's phenotype would be categorized as a “normal” metabolizer.
