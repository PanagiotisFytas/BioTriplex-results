Bioenergetic effects of Minerval
The inhibitors oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone plus Antimycin A were sequentially injected by the Seahorse XF machine to measure OCR driving ATP production, maximal respiration, and non-mitochondrial respiration, respectively. In parallel, the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was also measured in response to these inhibitors. These Seahorse bioenergetic profiling experiments were applied to the U87-MG (glioblastoma), A549 (lung adenocarcinoma) and, for comparison, MRC5 (non-cancerous) cell lines. Minerval at 200 µM was added for 24, 48, and 72 h to all cell lines. The choice of these times and concentration is based on previous work in these cell lines showing time-escalation of various cancer growth-diminishing parameters [ 3 , 5 , 10 , 12 , 18 ].  Figure 1  shows the raw results of these Seahorse XF bioenergetic assays. These results are quantified in  Figure 2 .
Tissue of origin-based comparison of the bioenergetic effects of Minerval
In the glioblastoma U87-MG cells, basal OCR ( Figure 2 A) and maximal respiration ( Figure 2 B), probably in consequence of the elevated baseline, are significantly increased by Minerval, especially following 48 and 72 h exposure. This increase in basal OCR, in U87-MG, but not in A549 and MRC5 cells ( Figure 2 A), explains the relatively high mitochondrial ATP production (basal OCR – OCR after oligomycin) instigated by Minerval only in U87-MG cells ( Figure 2 C). As the Minerval-dependent increase in basal OCR levels shows ( Figure 2 A), U87-MG cells progressively increase their energy demand [ 19 ] as time of exposure to Minerval increases. This increase in energy demand, observed only in U87-MG and not in A549 and MRC5 cells, possibly explains the U87-MG cell-specific up-modulation of mitochondrial ATP production ( Figure 2 C), which could be a U87-MG-specific pre-requisite for this cell line survival in the presence of Minerval.
In contrast with U87-MG cells, Minerval did not significantly affect basal ( Figure 2 A) and maximal ( Figure 2 B) OCR in both A549 and MRC5 lung cell lines, except for maximal OCR after 72 h exposure in A549 cells ( Figure 2 B), where the Minerval–FCCP combination was possibly too toxic, or reduced mitochondrial mass (see also  Figure 1 B). These observations can be explained in terms of the spare respiratory capacity (maximal OCR – basal OCR,  Figure 2 D): A549 and MRC5 cells have no spare respiratory capacity (basal OCR and OCR following FCCP addition are not significantly different,  Figure 1 B,C, upper panels). This observed lack of spare respiratory capacity in A549 and MRC5 cells, also corroborated in the literature [ 20 , 21 ], means that already at basal conditions, mitochondrial respiration generates ATP energy at its full capacity. Therefore, as opposed to U87-MG cells that do have a spare respiratory capacity ( Figure 2 D), no significant effect of Minerval on the already maximal basal OCR in A549 and MRC5 cells was observed ( Figure 2 A). Interestingly, the spare respiratory capacity in U87-MG cells was most up-modulated by Minerval after 24 h (and not 72 h) of exposure, possibly reflecting the relatively more pronounced effect of longer exposures to Minerval on the basal OCR ( Figure 2 A).
Cancer-selective bioenergetic effects of Minerval
Minerval-triggered increases in proton leak ( Figure 2 E) and consequent decreases in coupling efficiency (Oligomycin OCR/Basal OCR,  Figure 2 F) were distinctively observed in the cancerous U87-MG and A549 cell lines and not in non-cancerous MRC5 cells. These changes indicate that Minerval acted as a partial OxPhos uncoupler, which, similar to UCP2 overexpression for instance [ 22 ], increases basal OCR and proton leak, but still preserves OCR sensitivity to oligomycin and leaves room for induction of maximal respiration by an adequate dose of the stronger uncoupler FCCP. Compensatory glycolysis was also stimulated only in the U87-MG and A549 cell lines and not in the MRC5 cell line (compare  Figure 1  A,B with  Figure 1 C (lower panels)). However, this effect was qualitatively different between the two cancer cell lines: in the A549 cells, glycolysis was stimulated to the same extent independently of Minerval exposure time ( Figure 1 B, lower panel). On the other hand, in U87-MG cells, glycolytic compensation correlated with Minerval exposure time. As shown in  Figure 1 A (lower panel), in U87-MG cells the capacity to compensate for deficient respiration by up-modulation of ECAR is gradually compromised as Minerval exposure time increases: Following 24 h exposure to Minerval, U87-MG cells are able to up-regulate glycolysis (ECAR) after oligomycin, FCCP and antimycin A/rotenone are added. Following 48 h exposure, they are only able to compensate (up-regulate ECAR) for oligomycin and FCCP, and following 72 h exposure, they are only able to compensate for oligomycin, and even that to a lesser extent than after 24 and 48 h Minerval exposure. Interestingly, in U87-MG cells glycolytic compensation capacity is inversely related to the energy demand (basal OCR), which is increased by Minerval in these cells. Notably, non-mitochondrial OCR ( Figure 2 G) was not affected by Minerval in all cell lines.
The energy diagrams in  Figure 3  reflect both respiratory ( y -axis) and glycolytic ( x -axis) contributions to overall cell energetic status, both at basal (empty squares) and maximal (filled squares) respiration. According to these diagrams, Minerval treatment rendered U87-MG cells more energetic, or closer to the upper right-hand corner of the energy diagram ( Figure 3 A), while it decreased energy status in A549 cells ( Figure 3 B) and did not significantly modify the energy status in MRC5 cells ( Figure 3 C). These Minerval-caused changes apply to both basal and maximal respiration states. The inhibitory effect of Minerval exposure on glycolytic compensation capacity is demonstrated by the increase in the OCR/ECAR slope with time of exposure to Minerval, especially at 72 h ( Figure 3 A). Overall, the increase in energy status only in U87-MG cells supports the conclusion that Minerval was more toxic to A549 cells than it was to the U87-MG cells, while not affecting the non-cancerous MRC5 cells.
Minerval effect on metabolic cell viability
The effect of Minerval on cell viability and/or ATP levels ( Figure 4 ) brings together all its bioenergetic and metabolic effects. Overall ATP level is the ultimate co-reporter of both viability and energetic status. Reduced ATP level is a rigorous indication for cellular stress. Therefore, in order to determine whether the bioenergetic effects described above can significantly influence the cellular stress response to Minerval, we decided to analyze overall ATP levels. Our results ( Figure 4 A,B) show that while the energetic status of U87-MG cells was increased ( Figure 3 A), and while compensatory glycolysis was induced in a Minerval-independent manner in A549 cells ( Figure 1 B), these changes were futile inasmuch as they were not coupled to increased metabolic viability or ATP production in both cancer cell lines. In fact, Minerval at 72 h has reduced metabolic viability in U87-MG and A549 cells to an extent unmatched by the OxPhos inhibitors rotenone and oligomycin and only matched by the uncoupler FCCP ( Figure 4 A,B). The slightly larger drop in ATP elicited by Minerval in A549 cells (37% of control,  Figure 4 B), as compared with U87-MG cells (44% of control,  Figure 4 A) may also point to higher toxicity of Minerval toward the former. As opposed to the U87-MG and A549 cancer cell lines, no bioenergetic effect of Minerval was observed in the non-cancerous cell line MRC-5 ( Figures 1 C,  2 , and  3 C). Accordingly, MRC5 cells demonstrated no significant response to Minerval in terms of metabolic viability (as opposed to their response to the other inhibitors,  Figure 4 C).
In summary, our work demonstrates for the first time that the well documented [ 2 , 3 , 10–12 , 23 ] cancer-selective sensitivity to Minerval can also be manifested by mitochondrial and cell energy functions.
Minerval compared with an OxPhos uncoupler in U87-MG cells
The Minerval-mediated increase in proton leak and decrease in coupling efficiency observed in cancer cells indicate that in these cells the drug acts as an OxPhos uncoupler. We therefore decided to compare the effects of Minerval with those of the established OxPhos uncoupler FCCP. We opted to conduct this comparison in the glioblastoma cell line U87-MG. The justification for this decision is the following: as an anticancer drug, Minerval was so far tested only in glioblastoma patients. In addition, the glioblastoma cell line U87-MG is relatively less sensitive to Minerval ( Figures 3  and  4 ) and so has more room for mechanistically based improvement. As compared with other glioma cell lines such as SF767 [ 1 ], U87-MG cells generate more pronounced xenograft tumors that are also more responsive to Minerval (VL and PVE, unpublished results). Therefore, we conducted an in-depth comparison between Minerval and FCCP in U87-MG cells as a model for cancer. First we have demonstrated the dose response of the Minerval effect. As  Figure 5  shows, longer exposures to Minerval (at 200 µM) correlated with MMP depolarization and with attenuation of cellular ROS production. Minerval exposure time was equivalent to increase in FCCP concentration which produced similar effects on both MMP and cellular ROS production.
We have further confirmed the similarity between Minerval and FCCP by modular kinetics and mitochondrial dynamics.  Figure 6 A shows MMP and basal OCR values measured in the same batch of cells that were analyzed in parallel by the Seahorse machine (for OCR measurements) and by confocal microscopy (for MMP quantification). Treatment with an OxPhos uncoupler is expected to increase OCR as MMP is depolarized because this depolarization facilitates electron flow down the respiratory chain. By contrast, an electron transport chain (ETC) or respiratory complex blocker, such as rotenone which blocks complex I, would reduce OCR in parallel to depolarizing MMP, since it attenuates ETC flow. H + -ATPase blocker, such as oligomycin, on the other hand, would be expected to dose-responsively increase MMP as protons are prevented from re-entering from the inter-membrane space into the mitochondrial matrix and thus dissipating MMP. This block in MMP dissipation and higher MMP would hinder ETC flow that is coupled with proton extrusion from the matrix to the inter-membrane space. Therefore, as H + -ATPase inhibition gradually increase, OCR would decrease. Therefore, as can be observed in  Figure 6 A, our modular kinetics data prove that Minerval has a mode of action identical with an OxPhos uncoupler.
 B describes the effect of Minerval on mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondrial dynamics (the extent to which mitochondria are connected in a network or fragmented) determines energy expenditure and nutrient utilization [ 24 ]. These parameters are paramount to cancer cells proliferation capacity and invasiveness. As our results ( Figure 6 B) show, Minerval caused mitochondrial fragmentation, assessed by the area to perimeter ratio, and shrinking (area decrease). These effects of Minerval were pheno-copied by the uncoupler FCCP and, similar to the other mitochondrial effects ( Figures 5  and  6 A), were augmented with Minerval exposure time or with FCCP concentration. These results are consistent with increased OCR due to induced proton conductance, and not inherent proton leak. Induced proton conductance by chemical compounds such as FCCP, or by endogenous uncoupling proteins (UCPs), is associated with fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, through the fission protein Drp 1, into doughnut-shaped mitochondria [ 24 ]. These effects of Minerval, and FCCP as a positive control for induced uncoupling, can reduce ATP production efficiency (see also  Figure 4 ). ATP production efficiency can also be reduced by nutrient excess, also associated with increased fragmentation. However, in the latter case, MMP is increased (due to higher substrate availability from nutrients), rather than decreased, and thus also increases the inherent proton leak (positively correlated with MMP). These increased MMP and inherent proton leak are associated with an increase, rather than a decrease, in the diameter of solitary mitochondria [ 24 ], possibly because the inner membrane of the mitochondria has to accommodate more MMP determining proteins, mainly the adenine nucleotide translocators [ 25 ]. Therefore, the combination of mitochondrial fragmentation together with a decreased, rather than increased, diameter of solitary mitochondria points to a Minerval associated reduction of ATP production efficiency which is caused by induced uncoupling and not by a wasteful nutrient excess, as could possibly be expected from the faster internalization of Minerval in cancer cells [ 10 , 11 , 26 ] and its conceivable use as fuel. Therefore, Minerval reduces ATP production efficiency like an uncoupler and not by inefficient, heat producing energy transformation typical of cells under nutrient excess conditions. These data corroborate the well documented inability to metabolize Minerval as a lipid nutrient or fuel [ 6 ].
Minerval effect compared with other OxPhos inhibitors

           Comparative effect of Minerval on MMP 
           Figure 7 A (quantified in  Figure 7 B) shows that, similar to FCCP and to rotenone, administration of Minerval led to depolarization of the MMP. This effect was observed in both cancerous (A549, U87-MG) and non-cancerous (MRC5) cell lines. Expectedly, and also as a positive control for the ability to detect MMP modifications, MMP was hyperpolarized by the H + -ATPase blocker oligomycin (OM), which restricts proton flow through the complex down its electrochemical gradient. Having established that Minerval acts as a partial uncoupler, we decided to confirm these results microscopically by comparing the effect of Minerval to that of established mitochondrial inhibitors.

           Comparative effect of Minerval on mitochondrial ROS production 
           + -ATPase blocker OM can prevent proton re-entry through the inner mitochondrial membrane and consequent MMP dissipation and thus also hinders electron flow and generates ROS. These differences among the inhibitors and the observation that, like the uncoupler FCCP, Minerval too mitigates mitochondrial ROS production are shown in  Figure 8 , where mitochondrial ROS production is reported by the mitochondrion-targeted dihydroethidium derivative MitoSOX. MMP depolarization by the uncoupler FCCP occurs by a mechanism different than that of the respiratory chain blocker rotenone: while FCCP is a protonophore that mitigates MMP by mobilizing protons down their electrochemical gradient, rotenone blocks respiratory complex I thus inhibiting electron flow that generates this gradient. This fundamental mechanistic difference is expressed by the difference in ROS production: while FCCP facilitates electron flow through the respiratory chain thus diminishing premature reduction of dioxygen into superoxide and ROS production, rotenone slows down this electron flow thus enhancing mitochondrial ROS production. Similarly, the H

           Multiparametric analysis of the effects of Minerval on U87-MG cells 
           Figure 9 ). This effect was significantly more pronounced following Minerval treatment, as compared with the other uncoupler FCCP, and was not observed when other OxPhos inhibitors—rotenone and oligomycin—were used (except for a significant increase in ER fragmentation caused by rotenone,  Figure 9 A,B). These results suggest that Minerval has a unique effect on the ER which goes beyond its effect as an OxPhos uncoupler. Furthermore, the fact that the increase in ER area was considerably higher than the increase in ER intensity suggests that Minerval induced ER dilation. ER dilation and fragmentation suggest that Minerval evoked ER stress, as already shown biochemically in U87-MG cells by up-regulation of unfolded protein response biomarkers [ 12 ]. Interestingly, another synthetic lipid evaluated as a cancer therapeutic, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide [ 27 ] has also dilated the ER. These ER effects may manipulate PE synthesis by the organelle [ 28 ] and its transport to the plasma membrane and may therefore have relevance for Minerval gain of toxic function. Furthermore, in our hands too ( Figure 9 D) this effect on ER stress was unique to cancer cells. Another effect observed by both Minerval and OxPhos perturbators is the increase in the number, area and spacing and decrease in staining intensity of lysosomes ( Figure 9 A,C). This effect is probably related to the increased cytotoxic autophagy induced by Minerval [ 12 ], as the lysotracker lysosomal stain we used can also identify autolysosmes. To obtain a more comprehensive picture of the influence of Minerval at the cell level, we have analyzed and quantified in U87-MG cells the effect of the lipid on cellular features other than the mitochondria using the unique high content, multi-parametric image analyzer InCell 2200 (see ‘Experimental’). Interestingly, Minerval has increased the area, vesicle number and staining intensity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in U87-MG cells (
