Materials
Glucose, paraformaldehyde (PFA) and sodium pyruvate were procured from Sigma. DMEM (with and without phenol red (for microscopy)), RPMI and EMEM media, as well as L-Glutamine, cell culture antibiotics (penicillin–streptomycin–neomycin), fetal calf sera, trypsin, trypan blue (for live cell counting in seeding), and phosphate buffered saline (Ca and Mg free) were all procured from Biological Industries (Beit HaEmek, Israel). CellROX Green, MitoTracker Red (CMXRos), MitoSox red, ER-Tracker red, LysoTracker Deep Red, DAPI, Calcein-AM Green, and TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester) were all purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Cells
We used three human cell lines: primary glioblastoma (U87-MG), non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (A549), and non-cancerous fibroblast-like MRC5 cells derived from fetal lung. U87-MG cells were grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 4.5 g/l glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mM L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and penicillin–streptomycin–neomycin. A549 and MRC5 cells were respectively grown in RPMI and EMEM media with the same supplements.
Bioenergetic assays
Bioenergetic assays (parallel monitoring of respiratory and glycolytic parameters) were performed using the XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit (Agilent, Seahorse) following manufacturer’s instructions. These measurements are based on extracellular monitoring of oxygen and proton fluxes by fluorescence-based probes. Specifically, for our experiments, cells were seeded in XF96 cell culture plates at 40,000 cells/well. Minerval (final concentration 200 µM [ 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 12 , 17 ]) was added for 24, 48, and 72 h [ 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 12 ], OxPhos inhibitors were added in the following final concentrations: oligomycin (ATPase inhibitor), 1 µM; FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, a protonophore), 0.4 µM for U87-MG cells, and 1 µM for A549 and MRC5 cells; Antimycin A and Rotenone (complexes III and I inhibitors, respectively), 1 µM. ATP levels were determined by the CellTiter Glo kit (Promega).
Confocal microscopy
Confocal studies were performed in the LSM 710 microscope (Zeiss) using a 60/1.35 NA PlanApochromat oil-immersion lens. The ImageJ software was used for analysis and quantification of the fluorescence intensity of the confocal images. To permit comparison of images, the same laser power and detector gain and offset were used for all compared images. The following fluorophores were used: The CellROX® Green Reagent (excitation 488, emission 520 nm; 5 µM in DMEM without phenol red for 30 min, followed by live imaging) to measure overall cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; TMRE (excitation, 543 nm, emission, 633 nm; 500 µM in DMEM without phenol red). In FCCP treatments, TMRE was added to the FCCP containing medium after 30 min without washing). TMRE readily accumulates in active mitochondria due to their relative negative charge. However, TMRE is poorly retained in fixed cells and was therefore only used by us to detect MMP dynamically in live cells. For fixed cells, we used the CMXRos (MitoTracker red) stain (excitation, 543 nm, emission, 633 nm; 500 nM in DMEM without phenol red for 30 min, followed by wash and PFA fixation). MitoSox (excitation, 543 nm, emission, 633 nm; 5 µM in DMEM without phenol red for 30 min before imaging), which is a mitochondrion-targeted dihydroethidium, was used to detect superoxide production (mitochondrial ROS)  in situ  in mitochondria of live cells. Mitochondrial size and fragmentation were determined by the Mito-Morphology macro added as a plugin to the ImgaeJ image analysis software. We analyzed our confocal microscope images using this macro.
Multiparameter analysis
U87-MG, MRC5, and A549 cells were cultured in specialized microscopy-grade 96-well plates (Grenier Bio-One, GER). Minerval (200 μM) dissolved in DMSO was added only for 72 h, in order to maximize its effects. Total DMSO concentrations were always kept below 0.1%. After a process of optimization, taking into account the growth of cells during the 72 h period of Minerval (200 µM) exposure, U87-MG and A549 cells were seeded at a concentration of 800 per well, and MRC5 at a concentration of 15,000 per well. In experiments where the effects of Minerval were compared with those of OxPhos inhibitors, these inhibitors were added to cells, pre-treated for 72 h with DMSO as a vehicle control, for 30 min in the same concentrations specified in  Bioenergetic Assays . Following the 72 h Minerval/control treatments, a mix of cellular fluorescent dyes in PBS was added to each well for 30 min at 37°C in a 5% CO 2  incubator. This mix included ER-Tracker red (1 μM, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stain), LysoTracker Deep Red (75 nM, a lysosome stain), DAPI (1:10,000, nuclear (DNA) stain), and Calcein-AM Green (10 μM, a cytosol stain used for cell segmentation). Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), washed with PBS and plates were transferred to an InCell2200 (GE Healthcare, U.K.) machine for image acquisition at 40× magnification. The output produced was based on comparative fluorescence intensity. Object segmentation was carried out using Multi-target analysis in the GE analysis workstation to identify the nuclei (DAPI) and cell boundary (Calcein Green). We further identified ER (ER-Tracker) and lysosomes (LysoTracker) as intracellular ‘organelle’ objects. All the assay parameters (including the acquisition exposure times, objective, and the analysis parameters) were kept constant for all assay repetitions.
