α-Hydroxy-9-cis-octadecanoic acid (2OHOA, Minerval) represents a new class of orally bioavailable lipids and is considered a nontoxic synthetic derivative of oleic acid that was designed to treat human cancer [ 1 ]. Minerval can impair proliferation by arresting cell cycle progress from G1 to S phase and has anti-neoplastic effects in cell and animal models of cancer [ 1–3 ]. Its mechanism is based on the regulation of the membrane lipid structure. This structural change causes changes in expression, localization, and activity of proteins such as the anti-proliferative protein, protein kinase C (PKC), activated by Minerval [ 4 ], the cell proliferation inducer E2F-1, repressed by Minerval [ 5 ], and the Ras oncogene translocated from the PM to the cytoplasm, and thus inactivated, by Minerval [ 6 ].
Anti-cancer drugs such as Minerval, which interact with membrane lipids and which modify the composition and structure of cell membranes, belong to a conceptually new approach for treating cancer called membrane lipid therapy (MLT) [ 7 ]. Minerval is a good example for an MLT drug as it increases the non-lamellar propensity of membrane lipids, activating PKC. In addition, Minerval reduces phospholipid surface packing at the interface between proteins and the polar regions of the lipid bilayer. This increased and enhanced fluidity allows hydrophobic domains of peripheral proteins to interact with deep hydrophobic regions of the membrane and/or fatty acid moieties of phospholipids which protrude out of the bilayer plane [ 8 ]. This is the mode of action by which Minerval anchors PKC to the plasma membrane and thus activates it [ 6 , 7 , 9 ].
In addition to modulation of the PM, Minerval also specifically modulates the activity of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS1), leading to an increased concentration of sphingomyelin (SM) in cancer cells but not in non-cancer cells, in which SM levels are already high [ 10 ]. These changes appear to be essential for the anti-proliferative effect of Minerval in glioma cells. In addition, Minerval can increase the levels of diacylglycerol (DAG), reduce the levels of oleic acid, which it can replace [ 11 ], and increase the amount of saturated fatty acids incorporated in ordered PC and PE domains in a number of cancer cells, in which membrane fluidity is relatively lower, but not in non-cancer cells. This increase in FA saturation in ordered domains increased their separation from the rest of the membrane thus reducing overall order and liquefying the membrane. Minerval mediated this local increase in saturation by inhibiting stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) activity, an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids [ 10–12 ].
Due to the promising anti-cancer effect of Minerval in lung and leukemic cancer cells and its lipid nature, it was decided to explore it as a treatment against glioma in a phase IIb clinical trial currently in progress (European Commission H2020-SC1-2017-Two-Stage-RTD: A Clinical Phase IIB trial with Minerval in patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma). This decision is based on the demonstration that Minerval has greater efficacy than the first-line standard of care temozolomide. It is expected that concurrent treatment with both will increase the patients’ progression-free and overall survivals. Moreover, in contrast with temozolomide, there is no apparent relapse in the tumor formation after treatment with Minerval [ 1 , 2 , 13 , 14 ].
As Minerval is known to increase membrane fluidity and to be selectively toxic to cancer cells, we set out here to explore the possibility that Minerval, like other hydroxylated fatty acids [ 15 , 16 ], can depolarize mitochondrial inner membranes and thus act as an OxPhos uncoupler selective to cancer cells. We tested the effect of Minerval, in cancer and non-cancer cell lines, on the bioenergetic parameters that should be modified by an uncoupler: Basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP levels, proton leak, coupling efficiency, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity. Moreover, we have also tested, in cancer and non-cancer cell lines, the effect of Minerval on the ability to respond to stress by up-modulating alternative energy transformation pathways. We have compared Minerval with other established OxPhos inhibitors in terms of its effects on MMP, ROS production, mitochondrial fragmentation, and changes in other cell features manifested as morphological modifications in different organelles. Our results suggest that Minerval functions as a cancer-selective OxPhos uncoupler with the added toxic value of compromising glycolytic stress response and enhancement of ER stress.
