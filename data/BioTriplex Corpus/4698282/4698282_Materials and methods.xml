Study participants
In this analysis, participants were restricted to 83,087 women of European ancestry from 37 case–control studies participating in BCAC, including 42,510 invasive breast cancer cases with stage I–III disease and 40,577 cancer-free controls. Of all breast cancer patients, 26,094 were known to have ER-positive disease and 6870 to have ER-negative disease. Details of included studies are summarized in Online Resource 1. All studies were approved by the relevant ethics committees and all participants gave informed consent (Michailidou et al.  2013 ).
Candidate gene selection
Candidate genes relevant to the Treg cell and MDSC pathways were identified through a comprehensive literature review in PubMed (DeNardo et al.  2010 ; DeNardo and Coussens  2007 ; Driessens et al.  2009 ; Gabrilovich and Nagaraj  2009 ; Krieg and Boyman  2009 ; Mills  2004 ; Ostrand-Rosenberg  2008 ; Poschke et al.  2011 ; Sakaguchi et al.  2013 ; Sica et al.  2008 ; Wilczynski and Duechler  2010 ; Zitvogel et al.  2006 ; Zou  2005 ), using the search terms “immunosuppression”/“immunosuppressive”, “regulatory T cells”/“Treg cells”/“FOXP3+ T cells”, “myeloid derived suppressor cells”/“MDSCs”, “immunosurveillance”, and “tumor escape”. The final candidate gene list included 133 immunosuppression-related genes (Online Resource 2). SNPs within 50 kb upstream and downstream of each gene were identified using HapMap CEU genotype data ( 2015 ) and dbSNP 126.
SNP association analyses
For the BCAC studies, genotyping was carried out using a custom Illumina iSelect array (iCOGS) designed for the Collaborative Oncological Gene-Environment Study (COGS) project (Michailidou et al.  2013 ). Of the 211,155 SNPs on the array, 4246 were located within 50 kb of the selected candidate genes. Centralized quality control of genotype data led to the exclusion of 651 SNPs. The exclusion criteria included a call rate less than 95 % in all samples genotyped with iCOGS, minor allele frequency (MAF) less than 0.05 in all samples, evidence of deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) at  p  value <10 −7 , and concordance in duplicate samples less than 98 % (Michailidou et al.  2013 ). A total of 3595 SNPs passed all quality controls and was analyzed.
Per-allele associations with the number of minor alleles were assessed using multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for study, age (at diagnosis for cases or at recruitment for controls) and nine principal components (PCs) derived based on genotyped variants to account for European population substructure. We assessed the associations of SNPs with overall breast cancer risk as primary analyses, and then restricted to ER-positive (26,094 cases and 40,577 controls) and ER-negative subtypes (6870 cases and 40,577 controls) as secondary analyses. Differences in the associations between ER-positive and ER-negative diseases were assessed by case-only analyses, using ER status as the dependent variable. To determine the number of “independent” SNPs for adjustment of multiple testing, we applied the option “--indep-pairwise” in PLINK (Purcell et al.  2007 ). SNPs were pruned by linkage disequilibrium (LD) of  r 2  < 0.2 for a window size of 50 SNPs and step size of 10 SNPs, yielding 689 “independent” SNPs. The significance threshold using Bonferroni correction corresponding to an alpha of 5 % was 7.3 × 10 −5 .
In order to identify more strongly associated variants, genotypes were imputed for SNPs at the locus for which strongest evidence of association was observed, via a two-stage procedure involving SHAPEIT (Howie et al.  2012 ) and IMPUTEv2 (Howie et al.  2009 ), using the 1000 Genomes Project data as the reference panel (Abecasis et al.  2012 ). Details of the imputation procedure are described elsewhere (Michailidou et al.  2015 ). Models assessing associations with imputed SNPs were adjusted for 16 PCs based on 1000 Genome imputed data to further improve adjustment for population stratification. To determine independent signals within imputed SNPs at  STAT3 , we ran a stepwise forward multiple logistic regression model including the most significant genotyped SNP rs1905339 and all imputed SNPs, adjusted for study, age and 16 PCs.
SNP association analyses and case-only analyses were all conducted using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC, USA). All tests were two-sided.
For multiple associated SNPs located at the same gene, a Microsoft Excel SNP tool created by Chen et al. ( 2009 ) and the software HaploView 4.2 (Barrett et al.  2005 ) were used to examine LD structure between these SNPs. To be able to inspect LD structures and also for gene-level analyses, allele dosages of imputed SNPs had to be converted into the most probable genotypes. Therefore, we categorized the imputed allele dosage between [0, 0.5] as homozygote of the reference allele, the value between [0.5, 1.5] as heterozygote, and the value between [1.5, 2.0] as homozygote of the counted allele. The regional association plot was generated using the online tool LocusZoom (Pruim et al.  2010 ).
Gene-level and pathway association analyses
Gene-level associations were determined by a subset of PCs, which were derived from a linear combination of SNPs in each gene explaining 80 % of the variation in the joint distribution of all relevant SNPs. Associations with derived PCs were assessed within a logistic regression framework (Biernacka et al.  2012 ), for overall breast cancer, ER-positive and ER-negative diseases, respectively. Pathway association of the immunosuppression pathway was assessed based on a global test of association by combining the gene-level  p  values via the Gamma method (Biernacka et al.  2012 ). For gene-level associations, associations with  p  value <3.8 × 10 −4  (Bonferroni correction) were considered statistically significant. To gain empirical  p  values for gene-level associations of  TGFBR2  and  CCND1  as well as for the pathway association, a Monte Carlo procedure was used with up to 1,000,000 randomizations (Biernacka et al.  2012 ). An exact binomial test based on the results of the single SNPs association analyses was carried out to estimate enrichment of association in the immunosuppression pathway. Gene-level and pathway association analyses were carried out in R (version 3.1.1) using the package ‘GSAgm’ version 1.0.
Haplotype analyses
To follow up the interesting gene associations observed, haplotype analyses were performed to identify potential susceptibility variants. Haplotype frequencies were determined with the use of the estimation maximization (EM) algorithm (Long et al.  1995 ) implemented in PROC HAPLOTYPE in SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC, USA). Haplotypes with frequency more or equal than 1 % were examined and the most common haplotype was used as the reference. Rare haplotypes with frequency less than 1 % were grouped into one category. Haplotype-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated within a multiple logistic regression framework, adjusted for the same covariates as in the single SNP association analyses. Global  p  values for association of haplotypes with breast cancer risk were computed using a likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without haplotypes of the gene of interest.
Gene expression analyses
In order to examine whether potential causative genes influence RNA expression in breast tumor tissue, we downloaded RNA sequence level 3 data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ( 2015 ). We retrieved the RNA expression level as the form of RNA-Seq by expectation–maximization (RSEM) based on the IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2 array. Gene expression differences in RNA levels between 989 invasive breast cancer tissues and 113 matched normal tissues for four genes of interest ( STAT3 ,  PTRF ,  IL5 , and  GM - CSF ) were analyzed using a two-sided Wilcoxon–Mann–Whiney test. In addition, data from 183 breast tissues in the GTEx (V6) ( 2015 ) publically available online databases were evaluated to obtain information on whether the most interesting variants (rs1905339, rs8074296, rs146170568, chr17:40607850:I and rs77942990) were expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for any gene. Also, GTEx was queried to obtain information on whether the five variants were eQTL for  STAT3  or  PTRF .
Functional annotation
To investigate potential regulatory functions of interesting polymorphisms, we used the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) database through the UCSC Genome Browser as well as Haploreg v4 (Ward and Kellis  2012 ).
