Single SNP associations
Excluding the known  TGFBR2  and  CCND1  breast cancer susceptibility loci, the quantile–quantile (QQ) plot for associations with overall breast cancer risk for the genotyped SNPs of the other candidate genes indicated deviation from expected  p  values and thus evidence of further SNPs associated with breast cancer risk (Online Resource 3). Genetic associations with overall breast cancer risk for all assessed 3595 SNPs are summarized in Online Resource 4.
Four independent genotyped SNPs (LD  r 2  < 0.3) were significantly associated with breast cancer risk at  p  value <7.3 × 10 −5 , accounting for the multiple comparisons (Table  2 ). The four significant SNPs were located in or near  TGFBR2 ,  STAT3  and  CCND1 . Since  TGFBR2  and  CCND1  have been identified as breast cancer susceptibility loci in previous studies (French et al.  2013 ; Michailidou et al.  2013 ; Rhie et al.  2013 ), we focused on the association of the SNP at  STAT3 . The variant rs1905339 (A>G) at  STAT3  was positively associated with overall breast cancer risk (per allele odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.03–1.08,  p  value = 1.4 × 10 −6 ). It showed similar associations with ER-positive and ER-negative cancers (Online Resource 5). We did not observe further SNPs that were significantly associated with ER-positive or ER-negative disease (data not shown).

To identify additional susceptibility variants at  STAT3 , we further investigated 707 SNPs that were well-imputed (imputation accuracy  r 2  > 0.3) and with MAF >0.01 spanning a ±50 kb window around  STAT3 . Seven independent signals at  STAT3  were found through the stepwise forward selection procedure. The genotyped SNP rs1905339 was not selected. The imputed SNP rs8074296 (A>G), which was in high LD with rs1905339 ( r 2  = 0.99), showed a comparable OR for the association with overall breast cancer risk with a more extreme  p  value (per allele OR 1.05, 95 % CI 1.03–1.08,  p  value = 8.6 × 10 −7 , Table  3 ). A second imputed SNP rs146170568 (C>T), associated with a per allele OR of 1.32 (95 % CI 1.16–1.50,  p  value = 2.1 × 10 −5 ), was still strongly associated at a  p  value of 3.2 × 10 −4  after accounting for rs8074296 (Table  3 ). None of the independently associated imputed SNPs besides rs8074296 were correlated with rs1905339 or with each other ( r 2  ≤ 0.01, Fig.  1 ). As rs8074296 and rs1905339 are located closer to  PTRF  than to  STAT3 , we additionally analyzed data of 178 imputed variants located within ±50 kb of  PTRF . Associations of most additional variants in the  PTRF  region with breast cancer risk were attenuated in analyses conditioning on rs8074296 (Table  4 ). The variants chr17:40607850:I and rs77942990 still showed a strong association with breast cancer risk (per allele OR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.04–1.15,  p  value = 0.0005; and per allele OR 1.09, 95 % CI 1.04–1.15,  p  value = 0.0007, respectively). These two variants were also not in LD with rs8074296 ( r 2  = 0.09 and 0.07, respectively) while all other variants in Table  4  were at least in moderate LD with rs8074296 ( r 2  ≥ 0.46, Online Resource 6). The LD plot (Online Resource 6) also shows that chr17:40607850:I and rs77942990 are in high LD ( r 2  = 0.83). A regional association plot for the genotyped SNP rs1905339 and all 885 imputed SNPs within ±50 kb of  STAT3  and  PTRF  included in this analysis is shown in Fig.  2 . Associations of SNPs shown in Table  3  as well as associations of chr17:40607850:I and rs77942990 with breast cancer risk were not significantly heterogeneous between studies (all  p  values for heterogeneity >0.1); forest plots can be found in Online Resource 7 to 16.

Gene-level and pathway associations
Gene-level associations with risks of overall breast cancer, ER-positive and ER-negative diseases, respectively, for the 133 candidate genes in the immunosuppression pathway are summarized in Online Resource 17.  TGFBR2  and  CCND1  showed significant associations with overall breast cancer risk ( p  value <10 −6  and 3.0 × 10 −4 , respectively). In addition,  IL5  and  GM - CSF  may be further potential susceptibility loci of breast cancer ( p  value = 1.0 × 10 −3  and 7.0 × 10 −3 , respectively).  STAT3  showed a less significant association with overall breast cancer risk ( p  value = 0.033). The immunosuppression pathway as a whole yielded a significant association with overall breast cancer risk ( p  value <10 −6 ). Similar gene-level and pathway associations were found for ER-positive but not for ER-negative breast cancer (Online Resource 17). We found significant enrichment of association in the immunosuppression pathway based on the results of the single SNPs association analyses (313 of 3595 tests significant at  α  = 0.05, exact binomial test  p  value = 2.2 × 10 −16 ).
Haplotype analyses
Despite the evidence for a possible role of  IL5  and  GM - CSF  in breast cancer susceptibility from the gene-level analysis, no individual SNPs at  IL5  or  GM - CSF  yielded significant genetic associations. To identify potential susceptibility haplotypes, haplotype-specific associations were assessed based on seven SNPs in or near  IL5  (rs4143832, rs2079103, rs2706399, rs743562, rs739719, rs2069812 and rs2244012) and nine SNPs in or near  GM - CSF  (rs11575022, rs2069616, rs25881, rs25882, rs25883, rs27349, rs27438, rs40401 and rs743564). The LD structures for these SNPs at  IL5  and  GM - CSF  are shown in Online Resource 18 and 19, respectively. In our study sample of women of European ancestry, 11 and 7 common haplotypes with frequency >1 % were observed at  IL5  and  GM - CSF , respectively. The haplotype AAAACGG in  IL5  was associated with a decreased overall breast cancer risk (OR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.93–0.99,  p  value = 5.0 × 10 −3 , Table  5 ). In  GM - CSF , the haplotype AAGAGCGAA was also associated with a decreased overall breast cancer risk  ( OR 0.92, 95 % CI 0.87–0.96,  p  value = 2.7 × 10 −4 , Table  6 ). The global  p  value for haplotype association was significant for both  IL5  ( p  value = 0.005) and  GM - CSF  ( p  value = 0.007).

Gene expression analyses
Using TCGA RNA sequencing level 3 data, we found that RNA expression levels of  STAT3  and  IL5  were significantly higher in 113 normal tissue samples compared to 989 breast tumor samples ( p  value = 1.3 × 10 −3  and 7.0 × 10 −4 , respectively, Online Resources 20 and 21), while overall expression of  IL5  was low in both tissues. Also expression levels of  PTRF  were significantly higher in normal tissue compared to tumor tissue samples ( p  value ≤0.0001, Online Resource 22).  GM - CSF  expression was very low and did not differ between breast tumor samples and normal tissue samples ( p  value = 0.49, Online Resource 23). Among 183 mammary tissues in the GTEx database, SNPs rs1905339, rs8074296 and rs77942990 were not significantly correlated with  STAT3  ( p  values = 0.36, 0.36, and 0.2, respectively; Online Resource 24 to 26) or  PTRF  expression ( p  values = 0.4, 0.4, and 0.39 Online Resource 27 to 29). The SNPs rs1905339 and rs8074296 were significant eQTL for  TUBG2  (both  p  values = 9.9 × 10 −7 , Online Resource 30 and 31). The  STAT3/PTRF  variants rs146170568 and chr17:40607850:I were not available in the GTEx database.
Selected characteristics of the study population are described in Table  1 . The controls and breast cancer patients included in this study had comparable mean reference ages of 54.8 and 55.9 years and also the proportion of postmenopausal women was similar (68 % in controls and 69 % in breast cancer patients). The proportion of women indicating a family history of breast cancer in first degree relatives was as expected greater in breast cancer patients (25 %) than in controls (12 %).
