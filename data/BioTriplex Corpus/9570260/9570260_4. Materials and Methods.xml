4.1. Test Compound
Gallic acid with a purity of 98%, according to the manufacturer was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), and its stock solution (100 mg/mL) was prepared in 50% DMSO sterilized by 0.22 µm syringe filtration.
4.2. Borrelia burgdorferi Culture
Low passage isolate of the B31 strain of  B. burgdorferi  was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The B31 strain is an isolate from  Ixodes dammini  and prepared for testing according to previous reports [ 7 , 25 , 26 , 27 ]. Briefly, the cryostocks of both species were cultured under commonly used conditions, i.e., Barbour–Stoner–Kelly H (BSK-H) medium, supplemented with 6% rabbit serum (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), without antibiotics, at 33 °C with 5% CO 2 , in 15 mL polypropylene sterile test tubes. Homogeneous logarithmic culture (having only typical motile spirochetes/active form) of  B. burgdorferi  was obtained by maintaining inoculum in a shaking incubator at 33 °C and 250 rpm for 2–3 days. Stationary culture (enriched in knob-/round-shaped cells/persistent forms) of  B. burgdorferi  was generated by maintaining inoculum in an incubator at 33 °C for 7–8 days. Biofilm like aggregates of  B. burgdorferi  were prepared by incubation of inoculums in four-well chambers (BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD, USA) coated with collagen type I from rat tail for approximately 7 days.
4.3. Evaluation of the Biocidal Efficacy of Gallic Acid against Borrelia burgdorferi
Testing was assessed as previously reported [ 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ]. Briefly, 96-well plates with 0.1 mL BSK-H medium were inoculated with 2 × 10 5 –1 × 10 6  cells/mL (logarithmic phase, i.e., 2–3 days culture, or stationary phase, i.e., 7–8 days) and supplemented with the test compound. Control wells were treated with DMSO (0.125%). Next, the plates were incubated at 33 °C with 5% CO 2  for 72 h. Assessment was done using high-throughput spectrofluorometric screening with SYBER Green I/IP staining (Nikon, Eclipse E600, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. The excitation wavelength was set at 485 nm and the absorbance wavelength at 535 nm. The biocidal effect of the gallic acid against biofilm like aggregates was evaluated in four-well chambers coated with collagen type I from rat tail as described [ 6 , 29 ]. Briefly, 1 × 10 7  cells/mL was inoculated into each sterile chamber filled with 1 mL BSK-H medium and incubated for one week at 33 °C with 5% CO 2 , followed by 72 h of incubation with the test compound. Control wells contained DMSO (0.125%). Earlier studies in our laboratory have documented a lack of antifungal carryover using this procedure [ 28 ]. For quantitative assessment, all wells were fixed with 500 µL of cold formalin acetic acid mixture for 20 min, followed by staining with 200 µL of SYBER Green I/IP staining mixture for 15 min in the dark [ 29 , 31 ]. Pictures were immediately taken from untreated and treated mounted slides using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Eclipse E600). Results are expressed as a percentage of gallic acid-free control (mean +/− SD,  n  = 4).
4.4. Analysis of Cytokine Secretion
Proinflammatory cytokine release was assessed using the Human Cytokines ELISA array assay kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 100 µL of supernatant of CD14+ macrophages (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) was incubated for 2 h in 96-well plates at RT with gentle shaking. After the incubation period, all wells were washed three times with 1 × Assay Wash Buffer and again incubated with 100 µL of biotin-labeled antibody mixture for 1 h at RT with gentle shaking. Next, the washing step was repeated, and all wells were again incubated with streptavidin-HRP conjugated for 45 min at RT with gentle shaking followed by the washing step. Signal was developed with TMB substrate followed by adding stop solution. Optical density was measured within 30 min at 450 nm. Results are expressed as a percentage of gallic-acid-free control (mean +/− SD,  n  = 4).
4.5. NFκB Activity Assay
NFκB activity was performed according to Indigo Biosciences assay kit (State College, PA, USA). Briefly, a 21 mL suspension of NFκB reporter cells was dispensed into a 96-well plate (200 µL per well) and preincubated in a cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO 2 ) for 4–6 h. The medium was then removed, and cells were rinsed with cell screening medium (CSM) and replaced with stock solution of gallic acid diluted with CSM to the desired final assay concentrations. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at 3 nM, as well as a ‘no treatment’ control, were included. The plates were transferred into a culture incubator for 22–24 h. Subsequently, the treatment medium was discarded and 100 µL of luciferase detection reagent (LDR) was added to each well of the assay plate. After 5 min, chemiluminescence was measured. Results are expressed as a percentage of gallic-acid-free control (mean +/− SD,  n  = 4).
4.6. RT-qPCR
Genome copies of target genes in CD14+ cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were quantified by extracting RNA by use of a RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Extracted RNA was then taken for cDNA synthesis using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit following the manufacture’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Two-step RT-qPCR using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was performed for each sample in triplicates with PrimeTime qPCR Primer Assays (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and BioRad CFX instrument (Hercules, CA, USA), with cycling parameters as: 5 min at 95 °C; and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Genomic copies were normalized to the relative expression of the human β-actin gene using PrimeTime qPCR Primer Assay (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
4.7. Western Blot
CD14+ cells were lysed using lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 7.4), 1.0%] Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, 2.0 mM Na 3 VO 4 , and 1 X complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA)]. The protein concentration was measured by the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The protein samples (50 µg/well) were separated on 8–16% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (i.e., Tris-based electrophoresis using the standard Laemmle’s method) and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Specific proteins were detected either with commercially available anti-CD14+ antibody at 1:1000 dilution, anti-p65 and anti-p-p65 antibodies at 1:1000 dilution, anti-p50 and anti-p-p50 antibodies at 1:1000 dilution, anti-IKK α and anti-p-IKK α/β antibodies at 1:1000 dilution, and anti-β-actin antibody at 1:2500 dilution serving as a loading control. WB images were acquired using the Azure cSeries system and autoexposure settings (Azure Biosystems, Dublin, CA, USA). Original Western blot images are located in  Supplementary Information file .
4.8. Viability Assay
Cellular viability was assessed using MTT assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates at 1 × 10 5  cells per well in RPMI containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with the same medium supplemented with the gallic acid (0–100 µg/mL). After 24 h of treatment, cell viability was measured at 570 nm, using an ELISA reader (Molecular Device, Spectra Max 340, San Jose, CA, USA). Results are expressed as a percentage of gallic-acid-free control (mean +/− SD,  n  = 8).
4.9. Statistical Analysis
Data for all experiments, unless indicated otherwise, are presented as an average value and standard deviation from at least three independent experiments, each at least in three replicates. Comparison between different samples was done by a two-tailed  t -test using the SPSS data analysis software. Differences between samples were considered significant at  p  values lower than 0.05.
