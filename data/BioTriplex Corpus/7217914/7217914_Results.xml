CircZNF609 is highly expressed and featured with loop structure in HCC
The potential role of circZNF609 in HCC remains to be analyzed, though a former investigation has revealed the oncogenic function of hsa_circ_0000615 (circZNF609) on breast cancer tumorigenesis and progression 24 . To further understand the specific function that circZNF609 exerted on the complicated course of HCC development, it is primarily needed to detect the expression level of circZNF609 in HCC cell lines (HepG2, Huh-7, HCCLM3, and MHCC-97H) and normal human liver epithelial cell line (THLE-3). RT-qPCR analysis exhibited a remarkable upregulation of circZNF609 in HCC cell lines compared with that in normal human liver epithelial cell line (Fig.  1a ). Prior to functional experiments related to circZNF609 in HCC, the feature of circZNF609 with loop structure need to be testified. First of all, the genomic location of circZNF609, together with its splicing pattern was displayed in Fig.  1b . Subsequently, data from nucleic acid electrophoresis analysis indicated that divergent primers were able to generate the circular isoform of ZNF609 with cDNA but not with gDNA, whereas convergent primers were capable of amplifying the linear isoform of ZNF609 from both cDNA and gDNA in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells (Fig.  1c ). After HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells were treated with Actinomycin D (ActD, an inhibitor of transcription), ZNF609 mRNA was digested while circZNF609 was apt to be more stable and resistant (Fig.  1d ). In addition, ZNF609 mRNA was degraded whereas circZNF609 demonstrated no obvious change in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells after treatment with RNase R (Fig.  1e ). Last but not least, RT-qPCR was utilized to examine the expression status of circZNF609 in 49 pairs HCC tissues, as well as peri-tumor tissues and revealed an evidently increased expression of circZNF609 in HCC tissues in comparison with that in peri-tumor (Fig.  1f ). Taken together, circZNF609 is overexpressed and characterized with loop structure in HCC. Fig. 1 CircZNF609 is highly expressed and featured with loop structure in HCC. a  RT-qPCR assay was conducted to detect the expression level of circZNF609 in HCC cell lines (HepG2, Huh-7, HCCLM3, and MHCC-97H) and normal human liver epithelial cell line (THLE-3).  b  The genomic location of circZNF609 together with its splicing pattern was displayed.  c  Nucleic acid electrophoresis analysis revealed that divergent primers amplified circular isoform of ZNF609 with cDNA, but not with genomic DNA (gDNA). GAPDH was used as a negative control.  d  The resistance of circZNF609 and ZNF609 mRNA to ActD was detected by RT-qPCR in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells.  e  RT-qPCR assay was carried out to determine the abundance of circZNF609 and linear ZNF609 mRNA in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells treated with RNase R (normalized to mock treatment).  f  The expression status of circZNF609 in HCC tissues and peri-tumor tissues was detected via RT-qPCR.  * P  < 0.05,  ** P  < 0.01.
Downregulation of circZNF609 impairs HCC cell proliferation, metastasis, and stemness
After realizing the significant upregulation of circZNF609 expression in HCC tissues and cells and the high stability of circZNF609 due to its circular structure, we decided to further explore the underlying biological role and molecular mechanism of circZNF609 in HCC. Prior to loss-of-function assays, the knockdown efficiency of circZNF609 ought to be measured by RT-qPCR at first in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells. Moreover, the result showed that compared with negative control, circZNF609 expression was observably downregulated in sh-circZNF609#1/2-transfected cells (Fig.  2a ). Afterwards, cell proliferation ability was evaluated by CCK-8 and colony formation assays in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells transfected with sh-circZNF609#1/2 or sh-NC. The result uncovered that knockdown of circZNF609 suppressed cell proliferation (Fig.  2b, c ). Additionally, the sphere formation ability of HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells was restrained by circZNF609 deficiency (Fig.  2d ). Besides, the apoptosis capability of transfected cells was evaluated by flow cytometry and TUNEL analyses and confirmed to be enhanced by circZNF609 depletion (Fig.  2e, f ). Western blot analysis later depicted that circZNF609 downregulation led to a decreased expression of Bcl-2 but an elevated expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-6, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP, indicating a promoting function of circZNF609 knockdown on cell apoptosis (Fig.  2g ). The follow-up transwell assay demonstrated that circZNF609 silencing repressed cell migration and invasion in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells (Fig.  2h ). Finally, it was obtained from western blot analysis that the expression of MMP2, MMP7, N-cadherin, OCT4, Nanog, and Twist was reduced by silenced circZNF609 while the expression of E-cadherin was on the contrary, suggesting that knocking down circZNF609 could suppress cell metastasis, EMT and stemness (Fig.  2 i). In brief, knocking down circZNF609 impairs HCC cell proliferation, metastasis and stemness. Fig. 2 Downregulation of circZNF609 impairs HCC cell proliferation, metastasis, and stemness. a  The knockdown efficiency of circZNF609 was measured by RT-qPCR in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells.  b ,  c  CCK-8 and colony formation assays were carried out to measure the proliferation ability of transfected cells.  d  Sphere formation assay was used to evaluate cell sphere formation ability in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells transfected with different plasmids.  e – g  The apoptosis capability of transfected cells was analyzed by flow cytometry, TUNEL, and western blot analyses.  h  Transwell assay was performed to examine the migration and invasion abilities of transfected cells. I Western blot analysis depicted that knocking down circZNF609 could suppress cell metastasis, EMT, and stemness.  ** P  < 0.01.
CircZNF609 activates Hedgehog pathway to regulate HCC progression
To investigate the possible regulatory mechanism of circZNF609 in HCC, we silenced circZNF609, and then adopted microarray and KEGG analyses to detect the expression of its downstream target genes. The result suggested that genes with differential differences in expression were closely related to Hedgehog pathway (Fig.  3a ). Subsequently, SAG (an agonist of Hedgehog pathway) was used to test whether Hedgehog pathway was involved in the regulation of circZNF609 on HCC progression. As illustrated in Fig.  3b, c , cell proliferation ability was weakened by knockdown of circZNF609 and then the effect was restored by addition of SAG in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells. Moreover, an attenuated cell sphere formation ability caused by circZNF609 deficiency was reversed after adding SAG to HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells (Fig.  3d ). Flow cytometry and TUNEL analyses delineated that the addition of SAG countervailed circZNF609 depletion-mediated promoting effect on cell apoptosis (Fig.  3e ). Western blot analysis displayed that the addition of SAG reversed the impact that circZNF609 silencing elicited on the expression of apoptosis-linked proteins, indicating that the addition of SAG offset the function of circZNF609 knockdown on cell apoptosis (Fig.  3f ). Moreover, transwell assay demonstrated that the restrained abilities of migration and invasion in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells induced by circZNF609 silencing was then reversed by addition of SAG (Fig.  3g ). Final western blot analysis showed that the addition of SAG counteracted circZNF609 knockdown-mediated function on the expression of the metastasis-associated proteins (MMP2 and MMP7), EMT-related proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Twist), and stemness-linked proteins (OCT4 and Nanog), suggesting that the addition of SAG could partially restore circZNF609 downregulation-mediated suppressive effect on cell metastasis, EMT and stemness (Fig.  3h ). All these findings reveal that circZNF609 regulates HCC progression via activation of Hedgehog pathway. Fig. 3 CircZNF609 activates Hedgehog pathway to regulate HCC progression. a  Microarray and KEGG analyses were applied to detect the expression of the downstream target genes of circZNF609 after circZNF609 was silenced. The result suggested that genes with differential differences in expression were closely related to Hedgehog pathway.  b ,  c  The proliferation ability of HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells transfected with different plasmids was measured by CCK-8 and colony formation assays.  d  Cell sphere formation ability in transfected cells was assessed by sphere formation assay.  e ,  f  Flow cytometry, TUNEL, and western blot analyses were employed to analyze the apoptosis capability of transfected cells.  g  Transwell assay was used to examine the migration and invasion capabilities of transfected cells.  h  Cell metastasis, EMT, and stemness in transfected cells were examined by western blot analysis.  * P  < 0.05,  ** P  < 0.01.
CircZNF609 activates Hedgehog pathway via the regulation of miR-15a-5p/15b-5p and GLI2 expressions in HCC
To further understand how circZNF609 activated Hedgehog pathway in the regulation of HCC development, western blot analysis was conducted at first to detect the expression of several proteins related to Hedgehog pathway and uncovered that only the expression of GLI2 (a key protein molecule concerning Hedgehog pathway) was lowered by circZNF609 knockdown in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells (Fig.  4a ). Then subcellular fractionation and FISH assays detected that circZNF609 was mainly located in cytoplasm of HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells (Fig.  4b ). Hence, an assumption was made that circZNF609 might mediate the activation of Hedgehog pathway by post-transcriptionally regulating GLI2 expression via certain miRNA in HCC. Afterwards, starBase was utilized and obtained 7 miRNAs that not only could bind with circZNF609, but also could bind with GLI2. Moreover, then RT-qPCR detected a significant downregulation of miR-15a-5p and miR-15b-5p in four HCC cell lines (Fig.  4c ). Furthermore, in comparison with peri-tumor tissues, a distinctly decreased expression of miR-15a-5p and miR-15b-5p, and an obviously elevated expression of GLI2 in HCC tissues were observed (Fig.  4d, e ). Moreover, the negative correlation between miR-15a-5p/15b-5p and circZNF609 (or GLI2), as well as the positive correlation between circZNF609 and GLI2 was obtained through Spearman’s correlation analysis (Fig.  4f, g ). Besides, silenced circZNF609 resulted in a significant elevation of miR-15a-5p/15b-5p expression in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells (Supplementary Fig.  1A ). In sum, circZNF609 activates Hedgehog pathway via the regulation of miR-15a-5p/15b-5p and GLI2 expressions in HCC. Fig. 4 CircZNF609 activates Hedgehog pathway via the regulation of miR-15a-5p/15b-5p and GLI2 expressions in HCC. a  Western blot analysis was applied to detect the expression of GLI1, GLI2, GLI3, and GLI4 in different groups.  b  Subcellular fractionation and FISH assays were adopted to detect the distribution of circZNF609 in cytoplasm and nucleus.  c  StarBase was utilized and obtained seven miRNAs that not only could bind with circZNF609, but also could bind with GLI2. Moreover, then RT-qPCR was performed to detect the expression of these miRNAs in HCC cell lines and normal human liver epithelial cell line.  d ,  e  The expression of miR-15a-5p/15b-5p and GLI2 was detected in HCC tissues and peri-tumor.  f ,  g  The correlation between miR-15a-5p/15b-5p and circZNF609 (or GLI2), together with the correlation between circZNF609 and GLI2 was analyzed by Spearman’s correlation analysis.  * P  < 0.05,  ** P  < 0.01.
CircZNF609 mediates HCC progression through the regulation of miR-15a-5p/15b-5p and GLI2 expressions
Proceeding with this study, we planned to further explore the relationship among circZNF609, miR-15a/15b-5p and GLI2 in HCC. First, RIP assay displayed that circZNF609, miR-15a-5p/15b-5p and GLI2 were all enriched in anti-Ago2 group rather than anti-IgG group, suggesting the coexistence of circZNF609, miR-15a/15b-5p and GLI2 in RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Fig.  5a ). The following RNA pull-down assay confirmed that miR-15a-5p/15b-5p could bind with circZNF609 (or GLI2) in HCCLM3 and MHCC-97H cells (Fig.  5b ). Besides, luciferase activity assay showed that circZNF609 overexpression largely rescued miR-15a-5p/15b-5p mimics-mediated negative effects on the luciferase activity of GLI2-WT reporter, whereas the luciferase activity of GLI2-Mut reporter exhibited no evident change after the overexpression of miR-15a-5p/15b-5p or circZNF609 (Fig.  5c ). To further prove the molecular mechanism in HCC, rescue assays were employed in the following part. As displayed in Fig.  5d, e , GLI2 overexpression or miR-15a-5p/15b-5p inhibition rescued circZNF609 depletion-mediated inhibitory function on cell proliferation in different degrees. Similarly, GLI2 upregulation or miR-15a-5p/15b-5p suppression recovered circZNF609 depletion-mediated inhibitive effect on cell sphere formation ability to different degrees (Fig.  5f ). Likewise, GLI2 overexpression or miR-15a-5p/15b-5p inhibitor offset circZNF609 depletion-mediated promoting function on cell apoptosis at different level (Fig.  5g ). Additionally, overexpression of GLI2 or inhibition of miR-15a-5p/15b-5p countervailed circZNF609 depletion-mediated effect on the expression of apoptosis-linked proteins at different level (Fig.  5h ). Furthermore, cell migration and invasion abilities in HCCLM3 cells was repressed by circZNF609 deficiency, which was then restored to varying degrees by GLI2 upregulation or miR-15a-5p/15b-5p suppression (Fig.  5 i). At last, GLI2 overexpression or miR-15a-5p/15b-5p inhibition counteracted circZNF609 knockdown-mediated function on the expression of the metastasis-associated proteins, EMT-related proteins and stemness-linked proteins in various degrees (Fig.  5 j). To sum up, circZNF609 promotes HCC progression through inhibiting miR-15a-5p/15b-5p expression and elevating GLI2 expression. Fig. 5 CircZNF609 mediates HCC progression through the regulation of miR-15a-5p/15b-5p and GLI2 expressions. a – c  The relationship among circZNF609, miR-15a-5p/15b-5p, and GLI2 was confirmed by RIP, RNA pull-down, and luciferase reporter assays.  d ,  e  The proliferation ability of transfected cells was measured by CCK-8 and colony formation assays.  f  Cell sphere formation ability in transfected cells was examined by sphere formation assay.  g ,  h  Flow cytometry, TUNEL, and western blot analyses were conducted to evaluate the apoptosis capability of transfected cells.  i  Transwell assay was utilized to examine cell migration and invasion capabilities in transfected cells.  j  Cell metastasis, EMT, and stemness in different groups were examined by western blot analysis.  * P  < 0.05,  ** P  < 0.01,  *** P  < 0.001.
CircZNF609 contributes to the in vivo tumorigenesis of HCC
After conducting assays on the in vitro tumorigenesis of HCC, experiments concerning the in vivo tumorigenesis of HCC were required to further verify the biological role of circZNF609 in HCC. Then HCCLM3 cells transfected with sh-circZNF609#1 or sh-NC were inoculated into the flanks of mice subcutaneously. After injection for 28 days, mice were sacrificed and tumors were removed from mice for further analysis. As illustrated in Fig.  6a , silenced circZNF609 impaired tumor growth. Moreover, circZNF609 depletion decreased tumor weight (Fig.  6b ). Besides, a smaller tumor volume induced by downregulation of circZNF609 was observed (Fig.  6c ). Further, it was depicted by immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay that circZNF609 knockdown led to a lowered expression of Ki67, PCNA, N-cadherin, OCT4, and an enhanced expression of E-cadherin (Fig.  6d ). All these data elucidate that circZNF609 depletion inhibits the in vivo tumorigenesis of HCC. Fig. 6 CircZNF609 contributes to the in vivo tumorigenesis of HCC. a – c  HCCLM3 cells transfected with sh-circZNF609#1 or sh-NC were inoculated into the flanks of mice subcutaneously. Then tumor growth, tumor weight, and tumor volume were examined in different groups.  d  IHC assay was used to evaluate the expression of Ki67, PCNA, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and OCT4 in different groups.  * P  < 0.05,  ** P  < 0.01.
