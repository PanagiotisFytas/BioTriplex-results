Data Sources, Download, and Standardized Normalization
The proteomic and genomic datasets of HBV-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC-Gao cohort) were downloaded from The National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) ( 25 ). This cohort contained 159 tumor samples with matched controls, and 6,478 unique proteins were quantified (of which 298 were kinases). The transcriptomic dataset was downloaded from  https://www.biosino.org/node/project/detail/OEP000321 . Proteomic and transcriptomic datasets of the other HBV-related HCC cohort (HCC-Jiang cohort) were downloaded from related publication ( 16 ). There were 101 tumor samples in the HCC-Jiang cohort with 98 matched controls. This cohort contained 7,878 unique proteins (of which 369 were kinases). The RNA-seq data contained gene expression profiles of 35 pairs of tumor and control samples, quantified by tophat-cufflinks pipeline. 16,457 protein-coding genes were identified with FPKM > 1 in more than one sample (of which 634 were kinase-encoding). For HCC-Jiang and HCC-Gao transcriptomics data, we used the quantile normalization and log2 normalization on the FPKM-normalized RNA-seq counts and filtered out genes showing no expression in at least 20% of the samples.
We examined the data distribution of each cancer proteomic cohort and performed a standardized normalization procedure for each dataset. Each sample within a cancer cohort is normalized by its Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), so that every sample across the datasets are normalized to unit MAD. We also filtered out protein markers with high fractions (at least 20%) of missing values.
Identification of Differentially-Expressed Proteins
For each cohort, we performed a paired (tumor against matched-normal) analysis to identify differentially-expressed proteins by using the  limma  R package (v3.42.2). We corrected our analyses for confounding variables arising from batch effects when available (TMT batch, sequencing center/operator/date) or from demographics (age, gender), and the resulting p-values were multi-testing corrected using the BH procedure for FDR. For the majority of markers, we did not observe any significant confounding effect between protein expressions and the clinical variables age and gender ( Supplementary Table 3 ); the only suggestive association was observed between the HSP09AB4P protein expression showing negative correlation with patient age in HCC-Jiang cohort ( Figure S9 , p=0.038 before multiple-testing correction).
Detection of Overexpressed Proteins/Genes
To identify overexpressed markers, we used the OPPTI method ( 29 ). OPPTI is based on comparing expression levels to an inferred expression level in each tumor sample computed by a weighted k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, where the nearest features are the abundance level of other co-expressed markers. OPPTI performs a permutation test in order to evaluate the statistical significance of a marker’s potential enrichment of overexpression events. For a given cancer cohort, the dysregulation scores are permuted within every sample between the proteins, and the null overexpressions are computed from this data. After iterating this process multiple times, the null overexpressions accumulated from all iterations are used to establish the permutation distribution.
Somatic Mutations and Comparison With Proteomic Overexpression
We reasoned that protein-truncating or recurrent somatic mutations were more likely to be functional. We thus retained all truncations (i.e., frameshift/non-frameshift deletion/insertion/substitution, stop-gain, stop-loss) present in the HCC-Gao cohort. Given the smaller size of this cohort, we also considered all missense mutations that have at least three occurrences in the open-access mutation call set files from the MC3 project of TCGA PanCanAtlas that applied standardized variant-calling pipeline and quality control processes ( 40 ).
Analyses of Drug Screening Data in HCC Cell Lines
We downloaded the  in vitro  drug screen data on human HCC cell lines from Caruso et al. ( 30 ). We calculated the association of drug response with protein expression by using  limma  implementation in R (v3.40.6). For each drug, we performed the linear regression between the cell viabilities upon drug treatment and the targeted protein’s expressions across the drug-treated cell lines and obtained the corresponding coefficient of the linear fit. The resulting p-values were multi-testing corrected using the BH procedure for FDR.
