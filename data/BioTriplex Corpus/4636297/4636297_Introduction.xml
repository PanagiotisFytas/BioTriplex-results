Constitutive activation of PI3K signaling is one of the most frequent gene mutations in human cancer [ 1 , 2 ] and results in the activation of the downstream signaling molecule Akt, which signals cell proliferation and survival. In colorectal cancer (CRC),  PIK3CA , which encodes PI3K catalytic alpha polypeptide, is frequently amplified or mutated. Because the mutated PIK3CA plays an important role in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism,  PIK3CA  is suggested as a therapeutic target in CRC [ 3 ]. Additionally, inappropriate activation of the Wnt pathway has also been observed in CRC as well as many other cancers [ 4 – 6 ]. This Wnt pathway activation results in the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and the modulation of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcriptional activity to promote cell proliferation [ 7 ]. The two signaling pathways of PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin cross-talk through glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). GSK3β is a component of the β-catenin destruction complex, which also includes axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and casein kinase 1. In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3β and undergoes proteosomal degradation. In the presence of Wnt, the activated Frizzled receptor with Dishevelled disrupts assembly of the β-catenin destruction complex, and β-catenin is stabilized in the cytosol [ 8 ]. Additionally, phosphorylation of GSK3β by PI3K/Akt in the presence of growth factors results in the inhibition of GSK3β kinase activity [ 9 – 11 ], which leads to stabilization of β-catenin. Therefore, β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation via GSK3β activation constitute one of the anti-cancer action mechanisms of PI3K/Akt inhibitors. In addition, axin, by acting as a β-catenin scaffold protein, regulates the efficiency of the β-catenin destruction complex [ 12 ]. GSK3β is stably bound to axin, which is the least abundant core component of the β-catenin destruction complex [ 12 – 14 ]. Furthermore, GSK3β binding of axin directs axin to target β-catenin and shields GSK3β from the action of Akt [ 15 ]. The axin levels are regulated by tankyrase, which induces axin ubiquitinylation and proteosomal degradation. Studies with XAV939, a selective and potent tankyrase inhibitor, have demonstrated that it stabilizes axin levels and promotes β-catenin destruction [ 16 , 17 ]. It has also been reported tankyrase 1 is overexpressed in a variety of cancers [ 18 – 20 ], and XAV939 has been shown to be an effective anti-cancer agent for CRC and other cancers [ 21 ]. Furthermore, the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by tankyrase inhibitors enhances the efficacy of EGFR inhibitor for the treatment of lung cancer [ 22 ], which suggests that tankyrase inhibitors could be used as adjuvant cancer treatments.
Macrolides have numerous biological activities, including the modulation of inflammation [ 23 ] and of the proliferation of B16-F10 murine melanoma cells [ 24 ]. In a previous study, we reported that the 7- O -succinyl derivative of macrolactin A (SMA) inhibits class I PI3K enzyme activity and its downstream signaling pathway, PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6k,  in vitro  and  in vivo  [ 25 ]. In the present study, we report that SMA inhibits tankyrase in addition to inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, the study demonstrates that this dual inhibitory effect of SMA effectively suppresses the nuclear β-catenin level and TCF/LEF transcriptional activity  in vitro  and in a mouse xenograft tumor model.
