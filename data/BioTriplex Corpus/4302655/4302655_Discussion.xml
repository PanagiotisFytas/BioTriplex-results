Antigen entry to an immune privileged site like the eye can induce peripheral tolerance. If tolerance fails, it can trigger harmful immune responses leading to irreparable injury to terminally differentiated ocular cells encircling the corneal endothelium and cells forming the retina that lack regeneration capacity. Although ACAID-triggered peripheral tolerance could protect the complex structures encompassing the visual axis from any destructive consequences of immunogenic inflammation, blindness may ensue following damage to any of these cell types. Following antigenic entry into the eye, bone marrow-derived F4/80 +  APCs of the iris and ciliary body pick the antigen before immigrating into the systemic circulation and homing to the spleen where they develop antigen-specific tolerance through generation of Tregs [ 7 , 8 ]. The suppression of DTH responses is a typical way to measure the induction of ACAID-mediated peripheral tolerance [ 27 ]. Such suppression has been shown to be mediated by antigen-specific efferent CD8 +  Tregs [ 24 , 28 , 29 ]. Hence, it was presumed that the dominant Th2-like responses suppressed Th1 responses in ACAID.
Here, we tested the hypothesis that the AC injection of CII or the intravenous injection of CII-specific  in vitro -generated ACAID APCs induces immune deviation and specific peripheral tolerance in recipient C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice. Results indicated that CII-specific peripheral tolerance was generated after the AC injection. It was also generated after the intravenous injection of ACAID APCs that were CII specific. It is noteworthy that a potential application of the ACAID model is in the design of cell-based therapies administered  via  intravenous routes. Finally, we used LAT assays to test the hypothesis that  in vitro -generated CII-specific putative Tregs induce specific peripheral tolerance. ACAID-mediated peripheral tolerance was in fact detected after the intradermal injection of the putative Tregs.
We have previously shown the induction of specific immune tolerance in Balb/c mice through injection of CII into the AC of the eye or the intravenous injection of  in vitro -generated ACAID APCs specific to CII [ 17 , 18 ]. In the present study, we extended our observations to C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice, in which arthritis could be potentially induced. These findings could be beneficial for future examinations on the effect of the induction of ACAID  via  CII on the progression of diseases in which CII is involved.
The present study is the first to report that the ability to induce CII-specific tolerance in two arthritis-prone strains of mice, namely C57BL/6 and DBA/1. It will be interesting to compare the development of arthritis in each of these two strains when CII is injected after the establishment of the disease. The findings of this study have clear therapeutic implications in RA and could also be relevant to a variety of other human diseases in which CII is involved.
