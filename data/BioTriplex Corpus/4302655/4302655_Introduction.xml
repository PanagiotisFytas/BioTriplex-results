A prominent form of eye-mediated peripheral tolerance is termed anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID), which can be successfully induced in mice, primates and humans [ 1 ]. Following their entry into the immune privileged anterior chamber (AC) of the eye, antigens are regionally processed before getting picked up and processed by F4/80 +  macrophages [ 2 ] that induce peripheral tolerance mediated  via  secretion of TGF-β in concert with the concomitant down-regulation of CD40 and interleukin-12 [ 3 , 4 ]. These macrophages have been shown to induce an antigen-specific state of immune tolerance by migrating directly to the spleen [ 5 ]  via  bloodstream within the trabecular meshwork [ 6 ], and with the help of splenic accessory immune cells [ 7 , 8 ]. This form of tolerance is mainly characterized by antigen-specific suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions mediated through CD4 +  afferent T regulatory cells (Tregs) and CD8 +  efferent Tregs [ 9 , 10 ]. CD8 +  Tregs have also been proven to play major suppressive roles in various autoimmune diseases.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by the chronic inflammation of joints and is an autoimmune disorder which gradually erodes bone and cartilage. Type II collagen (CII)-induced arthritis has proven to be a powerful model of human RA and has helped delineate the roles of cellular and molecular mediators in the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint disease [ 11 ]. Degradation of CII has also been associated with ageing and osteoarthritis [ 12 ]. The clinical significance of CII in RA is well-established [ 13 ]. Studies reported that arthritis could be induced in C57BL/6 mice when immunized with CII [ 14 – 16 ]. CII-mediated ACAID induction resulting from the injection of CII into the AC of the eye or the adoptive transfer of  in vitro -generated CII-specific ACAID antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in Balb/c mice has been recently shown by our group [ 17 , 18 ]. In this study, we aimed to test for CII-induced ACAID in arthritis-prone strains of mice (C57BL/6 and DBA/1). We hypothesized that CII-specific immune tolerance can be induced either through AC injection of CII or the adoptive transfer of  in vitro -generated ACAID macrophages that are specific to CII into C57BL/6 or DBA/1 mice. We tested for ACAID generation following the AC injection of CII or intravenous injection of CII-specific ACAID APCs in C57BL/6 or DBA/1 mice by DTH assays. Further, we examined the regulatory functions of  in vitro -generated CII-specific T cells in C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice using local adoptive transfer (LAT) assays. This is the first study to report the  in vivo  and  in vitro  generation of CII-specific ACAID-mediated tolerance in DBA/1 and C57BL/6 mice.
