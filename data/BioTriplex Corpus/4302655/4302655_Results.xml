Type II collagen induced ACAID in C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice  via  AC injection as confirmed by DTH assays
We have recently shown that CII could induce peripheral tolerance in Balb/c mice  via  the AC injection of CII or the intravenous injection of  in vitro -generated CII-specific ACAID APCs [ 17 , 18 ]. Whether CII could induce ACAID in the arthritis-prone DBA/1 or C57BL/6 mice remains to be elucidated. We used DTH assays to test for the inhibition of CII-specific inflammatory responses. The procedure included priming the mice in the AC with CII (day 0) followed by immunizing subcutaneously with CII emulsified with CFA on day 7. This was followed with ear-testing of the AC-induced mice by intradermal injections of CII on day 14. Results showed significant inhibition of DTH responses compared to positive control mice that did not receive the AC injection, which confirmed that mice primed in AC with CII did develop peripheral tolerance (Fig.  1 ). This clearly shows that CII injection into the AC of DBA/1 and C57BL/6 mice could induce ACAID. The statistical significance data of experiments on C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice was as follows: Figure  1 A (C57BL/6): ACAID mice  versus  positive control, * P  = 0.00009 (24 h) and * P  = 0.00023 (48 h); Figure  1 B (DBA/1): ACAID mice  versus  positive control, * P  = 0.0035 (24 h); * P  = 0.00048 (48 h).
 -generated Type II collagen-specific ACAID APCs induced ACAID in C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice
We adoptively transferred ACAID APCs into naïve C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice on day 0 to examine the hypothesis that  in vitro -generated CII-specific ACAID APCs induce peripheral tolerance in C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice. The protocol for generating ACAID APCs is described in the methods section. On day 7, the recipient mice were subcutaneously immunized with CII emulsified with CFA. These mice were challenged with CII  via  intradermal injections in the ear on day 14. The significant suppression of DTH responses observed in these mice as compared with the positive control mice that did not receive ACAID APCs shows that tail vein injection of CII-specific ACAID APCs induced immune tolerance in both arthritis-prone strains of mice (Fig.  2 A and B). The statistical significance data of experiments on C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice was as follows: Figure  2 A (C57BL/6): ACAID mice  versus  positive control, * P  = 0.004 (24 h); * P  = 0.0025 (48 h); Figure  2 B (DBA/1): ACAID mice  versus  positive control, * P  = 0.000012 (24 h); * P  = 0.00029 (48 h).
 -generated ACAID Tregs impaired DTH responses
We previously showed that Tregs capable of suppressing DTH responses could be generated  via  the AC injection of CII in Balb/c mice [ 17 ]. Here, we tested whether CII-specific putative Tregs generated  in vitro  could impair DTH responses. Using LAT assay, the cultures were examined for the generation of putative Tregs 5–7 days after the co-culture of  in vitro -generated CII-specific ACAID APCs and spleen cells isolated from naïve mice. Briefly, spleen cells were isolated from naïve and CII/CFA-immunized mice. Approximately, 1 × 10 6  CII-specific putative Tregs were mixed with an equal number of immune spleen cells (containing effector cell populations harvested from CII-immunized mice) and CII (500 μg). Of 10 mM acetic acid, 20 μl injected into the right ear pinna was used as an internal control and the suspension (20 μl) was inoculated through intradermal injection into the left ear pinna of naïve C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice. Injections of CII-immunized spleen cells and naïve spleen cells with CII constituted the positive control. The negative control received only naïve spleen cells (2 × 10 6  cells) in addition to the CII. Impaired DTH responses to CII as compared to the positive control were demonstrated in recipients of  in vitro -generated CII-specific putative Tregs. As expected, negative ear swelling responses have been observed in the negative control. The statistical significance data of experiments on C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice was as follows: Figure  3 A (C57BL/6): ACAID mice  versus  positive control, * P  = 0.012 (24 h); * P  = 0.0025 (48 h); Figure  3 B (DBA/1): ACAID mice  versus  positive control, * P  = 0.00034 (24 h); * P  = 0.00002 (48 h).
