IDD is a common clinical degenerative disease, which can easily lead to low back pain, disc herniation, and other diseases, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients and bringing great economic burden to the society. At present, there are standard treatments for intervertebral disc degeneration in clinic, but these treatments encounter a “bottleneck,” that is, they can not reverse the occurrence of IDD, but can only relieve the pain of patients. Treatments based on MSCs and ncRNA are potential targets for the treatment of IDD and are of great research value. The molecular mechanism of MSCs in the treatment of IDD needs to be further explored, and a large number of clinical trials need to be designed to verify its feasibility and safety. Quite a number of ncRNA experiments have been carried out, but the role of some ncRNA in IDD is still controversial and needs to be verified by further experiments. Verified by reliable clinical trials, these reported data can be directly used in gene therapy for IDD, and drugs targeting ncRNA can also be designed to provide new ideas for the treatment of IDD.
