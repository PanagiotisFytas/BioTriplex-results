Intervertebral Disc Fusion

Intervertebral disc fusion has always been regarded as the standard for surgical treatment of symptomatic IDD. 42 
 
  The choice of the surgical approach includes anterior approach, posterior approach, posterolateral approach, and so on. 43 
 
  Minimally invasive surgery and open surgery are both available, and the surgical technique is quite mature, which is suitable for the vast majority of patients with IDD. Some studies have found that in intervertebral disc fusion surgery, compared with open surgery, the clinical effect of minimally invasive surgery is similar to open surgery and has great advantages in reducing muscle edema and surgical bleeding and contributing to postoperative functional recovery. 44 
 
 ,  45 
 
  Minimally invasive intervertebral disc fusion surgery uses a smaller skin incision and reduces paraspinal muscle peeling and soft tissue injury. Therefore, intraoperative blood loss and postoperative pain will be less, postoperative functional recovery will be faster, and hospital stay will be shorter. 44 
 
  But, the minimally invasive approach takes longer operation time and requires more proficient operators than the open approach.
Intervertebral disc fusion surgery usually involves the following steps. First, the surgeon separates the tissue and removes the damaged IVD, cleans up the IVD space, then places the prepared cage into the intervertebral space, which provides additional support for the spine after the operation. Then pedicle screws are used to fix the upper and lower vertebrae. After completing this critical step, the operator uses X‐rays to observe and correct the angle of screw placement and check the position of the cage. 46 
 
  If the operation is not effective or the movement pattern of the adjacent segments is changed, it may lead to further degeneration of additional IVD and motor segments. Once this happens, a second operation may be needed.
In terms of pain relief and functional improvement, the effect of intervertebral disc fusion is effective. Fritzell  et al . 47 
 
  conducted a clinical randomized controlled study with visual analog scale (VAS) score and Oswestry (OS) questionnaire as criteria for follow‐up. The results revealed that lumbar fusion surgery can effectively reduce pain and disability compared with non‐operative treatment. But the study is considered unreasonable because it compares routine care and fusion surgery rather than more comprehensive conservative treatments such as exercise therapy. After that, Brox  et al . 48 
 
  also designed a randomized controlled study involving 64 patients, which suggested that fusion surgery relieved pain and improved motor function effectively, but there was no significant statistical difference between conservative treatment and fusion surgery except OS index. The sample size of this study is small and the follow‐up time is only 1 year, so larger samples and longer studies are required to improve the recommendation evidence of intervertebral disc fusion.
Although intervertebral disc fusion can relieve discogenic pain caused by IDD and improve patients' disability, it can cause severe problems in the long run because it eliminates the movement of the adjacent vertebral body. When two vertebrae are fused, it seriously limits the damping effect of the IVD during motion, increasing the load and stress of the surrounding tissue and IVD, which will lead to the degeneration of other IVD in adjacent segments. 49 
 
  Therefore, in the past few years there has been a growing interest in total disc replacement because it can maintain the movement of the centrum.

Total Disc Replacement

Total disc replacement (TDA) was used by Fernström firstly in the 1960s. 50 
 
  He implanted a stainless steel ball into 191 lumbar IVD and 13 cervical IVD of 125 patients, and the clinical effect was similar to that of intervertebral disc fusion. However, the sinking and squeezing of the ball caused severe complications. With the development of biomaterials and the advent of artificial IVD, disc replacement is successful. At present, a large number of studies have produced evidence about the safety and effectiveness of TDA and proved that it is not inferior to the clinical efficacy of intervertebral disc fusion and provides the mobility of lumbar segments that intervertebral disc fusion surgery cannot provide. Skold  et al . 51 
 
  compared TDA with intervertebral disc fusion. Although both operations had satisfactory results for pain relief, TDA showed a better trend at 5‐year follow‐up. The randomized controlled trial of Furunes  et al . 52 
 
  demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the increase in the rate of adjacent segment degeneration after TDA compared with the non‐operative group, indicating that TDA does not increase the risk of adjacent segment degeneration. Berg  et al . 53 
 
  used distortion‐compensated Roentgen analysis to evaluate the difference between TDA and intervertebral disc fusion. Clinically, the surgical results of the TDA group were better, but there was no conclusion to explain the difference in terms of activity.
Qualified intervertebral disc implants must meet these requirements 54 
 
 : (i) maintain or restore the IVD function; (ii) high mobility, low friction, and high wear‐resistance; (iii) high stability when long‐term fixation; (iv) the ability to perform postoperative imaging. Moreover, lumbar disc implants are different from the cervical, not only because the load magnitude of lumbar is greater than cervical but also because of the moving patterns difference. 54 
 
 

Compared with intervertebral disc fusion, there seems to be no significant difference in the incidence of surgical complications of TDA. One study 55 
 
  indicated that there were more surgical approach‐related complications in the TDA group than in the LIF group, while another study 56 
 
  showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups. Disc replacement‐related complications included facet dislocation, pedicle fracture, device dislocation, and vertebral split fracture. 57

  Once complications occur, patients may experience postsurgical interventions. There are four types of interventions: revision, device removal, supplemental fixation, and reoperation. 61 
 
  The risk of these interventions is time‐specific regardless if a patient is healthy or not. 61 
 
 

In the field of surgery, there are always contradictory data in the comparison of intervertebral disc replacement and fusion. Each operation is supported by corresponding evidence and it is also affected by the experience and ability of surgeons. In the actual diagnosis and treatment, in the case of ineffective conservative treatment, we can choose any kind of operation as long as it can reduce the pain of patients. Achieving good patient satisfaction is the most important.
