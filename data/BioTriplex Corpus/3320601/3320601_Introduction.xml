The human nasal mucosa forms the first line of defence against challenge with inhaled bacteria, viruses and non-infectious particles. The highly vascularised mucosa is an attractive niche which permits a large and diverse community of bacterial species to asymptomatically colonise the upper respiratory tract  [1] . Invasion of the mucosa by colonising flora is prevented by innate defence mechanisms supported by an interacting sub-mucosal network of antigen presenting cells (macrophages and dendritic cells)  [2]  with effector T and B lymphocytes  [3] ,  [4] . The balance between mucosal immune responses and the expression and immunogenicity of bacterial virulence factors influence both colonisation success and occurrence of invasive disease.  Streptococcus pneumoniae  (pneumococcus) is a common nasal coloniser capable of causing life threatening human disease worldwide  [5] . Capsular polysaccharide is a critical virulence factor but anti-capsular antibodies alone do not account for the age related drop observed in the rates of colonisation  [6]  or invasive disease  [7] . An array of additional virulence factors including pneumococcal surface proteins A (PspA) and C (PspC) that mediate attachment to epithelial cells and the pore forming toxin pneumolysin have been shown to be critical for bacterial evasion of host defence  [8] . These pneumococcal proteins are immunogenic during colonisation and/or disease  [9]  and are therefore of interest as vaccine candidates. Mucosal vaccination with non-encapsulated whole bacterial cells  [10]  or pneumococcal proteins  [11] ,  [12]  are attractive strategies to elicit capsule independent immunity against pneumococcal colonisation and/or disease.
Pneumococcal carriage is common in infants, particularly among crowded, impoverished communities worldwide where carriage rates range between 20 and 95%  [5] . Infants serve as the source of transmission to other children and adults  [13]  but carriage rates decrease with increasing age as specific immunity develops  [14] ,  [15] . The pneumococcal specific immune responses that develop during carriage and protect against subsequent colonisation have been documented in mice and involve both antigen specific T cells and specific antibody  [14] ,  [16] – [19] . There are reports in humans correlating T cell  [20]  and antibody  [21] ,  [22]  responses to carriage. Pneumococcal carriage in infants  [23] ,  [24]  and adults  [22] ,  [25]  in the absence of clinical invasive infection has been associated with increases in the serum levels of immunoglobulin against pneumococcal proteins and capsular polysaccharide. Responses to pneumococcal proteins and to some extent capsular polysaccharides  [26]  depend on support from antigen-specific T cells to generate optimum levels of specific immunoglobulin. Carriage is known to be an immunising event  [25]  but it is likely that exposure without carriage also boosts levels of existing immunity in healthy adults  [27] . The end result is that in European adults in contrast to infants, the rate of pneumococcal carriage is very low despite frequent exposures.
We measured mucosal humoral and cellular immune responses before and after intra-nasal live pneumococcal challenge in human volunteers. We anticipated that pneumococcal intra-nasal challenge would lead to nasopharyngeal colonisation in our volunteers. Our hypothesis was therefore that challenge would lead to colonisation which would in turn elicit a humoral and cellular mucosal response. Our hypothesis also included the converse argument - that acute pneumococcal exposure (without colonisation) would not elicit a humoral and cellular mucosal response. Systemic immunisation requires efficient targeting and retention of antigen at inductive sites such as M cells or dendritic cells for priming in naso-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT)  [28]  and we did not know if this would occur or not following an acute exposure to pneumococcus. Our results showed that we did not achieve colonisation with 23F or 6B serotypes in 19 healthy adults. The pneumococcal exposure alone increased mucosal but not systemic pneumococcal specific immunoglobulin responses. Cellular immunity in mucosal and systemic compartments was unaltered by pneumococcal challenge.
