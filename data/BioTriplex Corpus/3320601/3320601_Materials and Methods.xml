Recruitment and ethics
Healthy adult volunteers were enrolled with written informed consent to a study involving inoculation of either  Streptococcus pneumoniae  type 23F or 6B, the two studies performed consecutively. We recruited non-smoking adults aged between 18 and 60 years with no history or signs of systemic or respiratory disease. Individuals who were already naturally colonised with pneumococcus or had regular contact with at risk individuals, such as young children, were excluded from the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee, Sefton, Liverpool (08/H1001/52) and the study was sponsored by the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals Trust.
Study design
Samples of blood, serum, nasal wash (NW) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were obtained before and after bacterial challenge according to two different sampling protocols ( Figure 1 ). Volunteers in our first study were intra-nasally challenged with two doses of 23F ( Figure 1A ) and in the second study a single dose of 6B ( Figure 1B )  S. pneumoniae  was used. In the 23F challenge cohort NW samples were collected 2 weeks and 1 week before inoculation and on days 2, 4, and 7 after each inoculation. In the 6B challenge cohort ( Figure 1B ) NWs were collected 2 weeks before challenge and 2 and 7 days following inoculation. NWs were then collected once per week for 5 consecutive weeks. A final set of post-challenge samples (blood, serum, NW and BAL) were then collected at 6 weeks.
23F and 6B preparation and volunteer inoculation
Clinical isolates of  S. pneumoniae  serotype 23F (P833 a gift of Prof. JN Weiser, University of Pennsylvania) and 6B (BHN418 a gift of Prof. P Hermans, University of Nijmegen) were used for inoculation. Bacterial stocks were grown to mid-log phase in Vegitone broth (Oxoid)  [29]  in order to avoid volunteer exposure to animal products and stored in 1 ml aliquots of Vegitone with 10% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich) at −80°C. Serotype confirmation was performed using latex agglutination (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen) and was confirmed by an independent reference laboratory (Health Protection Agency, Colindale, UK).
On each day of inoculation two aliquots were thawed, centrifuged and bacterial pellets were washed once before being re-suspended and diluted in sterile 0.9% saline to reach the desired concentration of bacteria. For the 23F cohort 9,000 CFU/naris in 100 µl saline were used for the first inoculation. If colonisation was not established following this inoculation we performed a second inoculation with 20,000 CFU/naris in 100 µl saline. For the 6B cohort 40,000CFU/100 µl/naris was administered. Volunteers tilted their head slightly back and 100 µl of bacterial suspension was dropped onto each naris using a P200 pipette taking care not to touch the mucosa. Serial dilutions of the original inocula were plated onto blood agar for dose confirmation ( Table 1 ).

Nasal washing and determination of carriage
NW samples were collected before and after challenge and processed as previously described  [30] . Briefly, a single aliquot of 5 ml normal saline was instilled into each naris with the subject seated leaning back supported at 45° to the horizontal. At instillation, the subject was invited to hold their breath and push gently on the back of the upper teeth with their tongue. Saline was held in the nasopharynx for 5 seconds and then poured out by gently tipping the head forward while holding a Petri dish under the nose. The samples collected from each naris were pooled. This process was performed once for the 6B cohort but 3 times for the 23F cohort. Samples were transferred immediately to the laboratory for processing. The first pooled aliquot obtained from each NW visit in both cohorts was used to determine carriage status (all negative except for one volunteer) and pneumococcal specific immunoglobulin analysis. NW samples were spun at 3345 g for 10 minutes and the supernatant stored at −80°C. The pellet was re-suspended in 100 µl of skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol (STGG) preservative medium prior to plating. 25 µl was plated onto Columbia Horse Blood Agar (Oxoid) with gentamicin (Sigma) and the remainder diluted to 1 ml with STGG and plated (50 µl) on blood and chocolate agar (Oxoid) for determination of co-colonising flora. Remaining STGG samples were stored at −80° for long term storage  [31]  and confirmation if needed. Plates were inspected after 24 hours incubation at 37°C, 5% CO 2  and alpha haemolytic, draughtsman-like colonies were sub-cultured to determine pneumococcal phenotype. Optochin sensitivity, bile solubility and latex agglutination testing were performed to confirm pneumococcal phenotype. Subjects in whom pneumococci were not detected from NW samples collected on at least 2 consecutive visits were defined as non-colonised. Colonised subjects are defined as subjects in whom pneumococci was recovered from any nasal wash.
The numbers of lymphocytes in NW were too few for analysis of cognate antigen specific T cell responses using flow cytometry. We measured the NW total cell count and also examined stained cytospin slides for increased numbers of cellular effectors and mucus deposits. Total cell counts in NW were determined from pooled aliquots 2 and 3 from the 23F cohort. Cells were pelleted at 400 g and resuspended in PBS. Cell counts were performed using 10 µl of cell suspension and a haemocytometer, with the final count given per ml of NW fluid returned. The remainder was pelleted as above and re-suspended in 50 µl of PBS and centrifuged onto a microscope slide using a cytocentrifuge (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 5 mins at 450 rpm. For the 6B cohort a representative sample of 10 µl was taken from STGG preparations (described above). These samples were made up to 50 µl with PBS and cytospins were prepared as described. Microscope slides were allowed to air dry before staining with Hemacolor rapid staining set (Merck, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An arbitrary semi-quantitative scoring system was used to assign whether an increase, decrease or no change had occurred.
Blood processing
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from volunteer samples using Lymphoprep (Axis Shield, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PBMCs were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2  at a concentration of 5×10 5  cells per ml/well in a 48-well plate in RPMI 1640 media with 2 mM L-glutamine (both Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% human AB serum (Invitrogen, UK). Cells were stimulated on the same day as collection.
Serum was obtained from clotted whole blood collected into serum monovettes (Sarstedt, UK). Samples were centrifuged at 2560 g for 7 minutes. Serum was taken and stored at −80°C for immunoglobulin analysis.
BAL processing
Bronchoscopy was performed using topical local anaesthesia with minimal sedation and BAL collected as described previously  [32] . Briefly, four aliquots, totalling 200 mls, of warm 0.9% saline was instilled and gently retrieved from a sub-segmental bronchus of the right middle lobe by gentle hand suction and the BAL placed into sterile pots on ice. BAL was processed as previously described  [33] . Briefly, whole BAL was filtered through muslin to remove mucus and 3 ml of unprocessed BAL was stored at −80°C. The whole sample was centrifuged at 470 g for 10 minutes. BAL supernatant was stored at −80°C for immunoglobulin analysis. BAL cells were re-suspended in RPMI 1640 media as described for PBMCs with the addition of antibiotics (penicillin 40 U/ml, streptomycin 40 µg/ml, neomycin 80 µg/ml (all P4083, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 µg/ml of amphotericin B (A2942, Sigma-Aldrich). Total BAL macrophages and lymphocytes were counted and 5×10 4  cells were centrifuged onto cytospin slides for differential staining as described. Remaining cells were then plated out into standard tissue culture plates to allow macrophages to adhere for 3 hours at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . Non-adherent cells were collected, washed and the pellet re-suspended in media as described for PBMCs. These BAL cells were then placed in 48-well plates at 37°C, 5% CO 2  and stimulated on the same day as collection as described below for PBMC and BAL cells. For each volunteer we ensured that paired BAL cells collected at each bronchoscopy were processed and incubated using the same serum lot number and lymphocyte count/well during stimulation.
Pneumococcal whole cell ELISA
Whole 23F (P833) and 6B (BHN418) strains were used as the capture antigen to determine the antibody titer to the pneumococcus in collected NW, BAL and serum. The whole cell ELISA assay was performed as previously described  [34] . Briefly, bacteria stocks were grown in Todd Hewitt broth containing 0.5% yeast extract (THY) to an optical density (OD 600 nm ) of 0.5. The bacterial pellet collected after centrifugation was then re-suspended in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer to an OD 600 nm  of 1. This bacterial suspension was added to 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) (50 µl per well) and the plates were incubated overnight at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Eight-fold serial dilutions of samples in 0.1% BSA were added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature in triplicate. Antigen-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were detected using alkaline-phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma) and biotin conjugated goat anti-human IgA (AbD serotec, UK), respectively, followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (AbD serotec, UK). 0.5 mg/ml of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) was added as a substrate. The OD was measured at 405 nm using a FLUOstar Omega (BMG Labtech, UK). The assigned titer value was determined as the last dilution in which OD is above 0.1.
Measurement of anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide antibodies by ELISA
Anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibodies were determined using the internationally standardised method and reagents  [35] . Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates were coated using 5 µg/ml of purified polysaccharides 6B or 23F (Statens Serum Institute) for 5 hours at 37°C. Wells were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (PBS-F) for 1 hour at 37°C. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS-T between each step. Samples were diluted in PBS-F containing 10 µg/ml cell wall polysaccharide mixture (CWPS Multi, Statens Serum Institute) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. When CWPS Multi is used, separate adsorption with the 22F capsule, is not required. 89-SF5 reference serum received from U.S. Food and Drug Administration was used as a standard. Diluted/adsorbed samples were then transferred to pre-coated plates and incubated overnight at 4°C. Bound antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma) for 2 hours at room temperature. 0.5 mg/ml of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) was added as a substrate. Optical densities were measured at 405 nm using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech, UK). All samples were run in triplicate in four dilutions. Results are expressed as µg/ml calculated using the assigned IgG concentrations in reference serum 89-SF5.
Measurement of anti-pneumococcal protein antibodies
The recombinant proteins PspA (clade1)  [36]  and PspC (group 5)  [37]  (GenBank accession numbers AY082387 and EF424119.1) were kindly provided by Dr Eliane Miyaji (Butantan Institute, Brazil). Pneumolysin toxoid (PdB) was provided by Prof. Aras Kadioglu (University of Leicester, UK) and PsaA by Dr Eddie Ades (CDC Atlanta, GA). Purified proteins were used to coat ELISA plates at 1 µg/ml overnight. The assay was then performed as described above for the pneumococcal whole cell ELISA. Anti-PspA and anti-PspC concentrations were calculated using reference serum samples with known concentrations assigned in the laboratory of Prof. David Briles and Prof. Susan Hollingshead for PspA, (both University of Alabama, USA) and Prof. Helena Käyhty for PspC, (National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland). All samples were run in triplicate in four dilutions. Anti-PdB and anti-PsaA concentrations are expressed in arbitrary units per ml calculated using a standard serum sample.
Western blot analysis
We prepared whole cell extracts (WCE) and choline chloride extracts (CCE) from the inoculated 23F pneumococcal strain grown in THY to 0.6 OD 600 nm . The cell pellet from 50 ml culture was lysed in a solution containing 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% sodium desoxycholate, 0.15 M sodium citrate  [38]  or 2% choline chloride  [39] , respectively. Choline chloride extraction is more effective at releasing the choline binding proteins on the pneumococcal surface. Protein extracts (5 µg of WCE and 3 µg of CCE) were separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Individual lanes were incubated at 25°C for 6 h with matched pre- and post-challenge NW samples (1∶25 diluted) from inoculated volunteers. Protein-specific antibodies were detected using goat anti-human IgG-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich). Detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (GE Healthcare). Comparisons were only made between experiments in which the antibody incubation and development of membranes were performed at the same time to control for assay variation.
Preparation of pneumococci for cell stimulation experiments
Serotype 23F and 6B  S. pneumoniae  were grown to mid-log phase in Vegitone broth (Oxoid) at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . To obtain pneumococcal culture supernatant, broth cultures were centrifuged and the supernatant was filtered first through 0.45 µm pore size and then 0.2 µm filters to remove remaining bacteria. Filtrate was then concentrated 10-fold by adding to pre-sterilised 10 K molecular weight cut-off Vivaspin concentrators (VWR) and centrifuging at 836 g for 25 mins at room temperature. This processed cell supernatant from culture broth defined here as ‘23F c/s’ or ‘6B c/s’ was stored at −20°C. Sterile Vegitone broth was processed under the same conditions and used as a control for stimulation experiments (‘vehicle’). Mid-log phase 6B pellet was killed by heat treatment for 30 minutes at 56°C and kept at −20°C in single use aliquots in PBS. The protein content of 23F c/s, 6B c/s, 6B pellet and vehicle was determined by Bradford assay. In addition, ethanol-killed acapsulate derived type 2  S. pneumoniae  (gift of Prof. R Malley, Boston, USA) at a concentration of 1×10 6  cells/ml was used as an  in vitro  pneumococcal challenge, relevant to the development of that product as a novel vaccine  [10] .
PBMC and BAL cell stimulation
We collected PBMC and BAL samples from 19 volunteers before and after challenge with 23F or 6B to determine whether nasal challenge with pneumococcus was associated with alteration in pneumococcal antigen-specific memory CD4 T cell responses in either compartment. PBMC and BAL cells from volunteers challenged with 23F were stimulated  in vitro  with the following antigens: 23F c/s (0.395 µg/ml), vehicle (0.26 µg/ml), 10 6 /ml whole pneumococcal cells (acapsulate derived type 2 donated and prepared  [33]  by Prof. Malley), 0.45 µg/ml heat-inactivated influenza vaccine (Split Virion, Sanofi Pasteur 2009/2010 strains) or left untreated (‘NS’). All experiments were performed in a volume of 1 ml in 48-well plates. PBMC and BAL cells from volunteers challenged with 6B were similarly stimulated  in vitro  with the following antigens: heat killed 6B whole cells (1.0 µg/ml), 6B c/s (13 µg/ml of which 4.2 µg/ml was pneumococcal protein), vehicle (13 µg/ml), 10 6 /ml whole pneumococcal cells (acapsulate derived type 2 donated by Prof. Malley), 0.45 µg/ml heat-inactivated influenza (Split Virion, Sanofi Pasteur 2010/2011 strains) or left untreated (‘NS’). Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 0.5 µg/ml (final concentration) as a positive control. Antigen titration experiments were performed to determine the optimum concentration required for stimulation. Cells were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. After 2 hours, 1 µl Brefeldin A (BD Biosciences, UK) was added and incubated for a further 16 hours before harvesting and staining for the presence of intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry.
Intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis
Cells challenged with antigen as above were spun to a pellet, supernatant discarded and the cells stained for flow cytometry. Cells were stained with Vivid according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) to allow discrimination between viable and non-viable cells. Cells were then stained for CD3, CD4 and CD45RO using the following mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies, APC conjugated CD3, APC-H7 conjugated CD4, PE-Cy7 conjugated CD45RO (all Becton Dickinson) on ice. Cells were fixed and permeabilised (Cytofix/Perm) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences) then stained for intracellular IFNγ, TNF and IL-17 using mouse anti-human antibodies: AF 700  conjugated IFN-γ, AF 488  conjugated TNF, PE conjugated IL-17 (all BD Biosciences, UK). Cells were fixed prior to acquisition on a BD LSR2 flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, UK). We gated viable, memory CD4 T cells (CD4+CD45RO+) and performed a Boolean gating strategy (data not shown) to identify the proportion of TNF, IFNγ and IL-17 producing cells (or combinations thereof) following  in vitro  stimulation with Influenza (positive control), whole pneumococci or pneumococcal culture supernatant from the respective challenge strain. In order to correct for inter-subject variation in the response to the Vegitone broth, all culture supernatant stimulated data were corrected by subtracting the percentage of CD4+CD45RO+ cells producing cytokine when cultured with Vegitone media alone (“vehicle”) from the pneumococcal antigen stimulated response. Responses to media alone were subtracted from Influenza or whole cell stimulated cells to determine specific responses.
Statistical analysis
Immunoglobulin and flow cytometry data were tested to determine the distribution of the data. Data with a normal distribution (Shapiro Wilks) were compared with parametric tests (paired students' t-test for before vs after inoculation) and for data not following a normal distribution; the Wilcoxon-matched pairs test was used. Flow cytometry data were analysed using FlowJo software version 7.6 (Treestar Oregon, USA). Graph and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad prism version 5.0 (California, USA). Differences were considered significant if p≤0.05.
