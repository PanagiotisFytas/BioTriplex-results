We anticipated that a low dose of live pneumococci delivered intra-nasally would lead to colonisation and thus augmented mucosal and systemic responses to pneumococci. Colonisation was not achieved in this study but we have shown that human inoculation with a low dose of live pneumococci elicits specific mucosal responses in the absence of carriage. Healthy adult volunteers with detectable humoral and cellular immunity to pneumococci prior to inoculation showed increased immunoglobulin responses in NW and BAL but not blood 6 weeks after experimental bacterial inoculation. In particular, concentrations of IgG measured following inoculation with 23F were increased compared to baseline observations in NW and BAL but not in serum using a whole bacteria ELISA. Concentrations of IgA measured following inoculation with 23F or 6B were increased compared to baseline observations in NW but not in BAL or serum. These responses did not include IgG or IgA to pneumococcal capsule. We measured IgG responses in NW, BAL and serum towards four pneumococcal proteins. We found that IgG anti-PspA was significantly elevated in NW (following 6B challenge) and BAL (following 23F challenge) and accounted in part to the elevated responses seen towards whole pneumococci. Inoculation was associated with an increase in the absolute count and percentage of mucosal memory CD4 T cells for the 23F cohort but not with an increase in paired antigen-specific cellular responses in either group.
Nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci occurs early in life, frequently in infancy  [5]  and less commonly in adult life  [40] . The most dramatic reduction in carriage and also disease rate occurs in the second year of life  [41]  independent of capsular serotype  [7] . Humoral and cellular responses to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide and protein antigens develop during this time. These immunological developments contribute towards a much lower incidence of pneumococcal mucosal and invasive disease in older children and young adults than in infants  [41] ,  [42] . Repeated episodes of carriage and possibly pneumococcal exposure  [13]  are thought to boost these important defences.
Experimental human pneumococcal carriage (EHPC) in adults offers the platform to measure these responses  [43] . EHPC in immune adults has been previously reported  [25] ,  [44]  but there has been no previous quantitative report of the mucosal humoral and cellular immune response to challenge not resulting in carriage. Most adult exposures to pneumococcus do not result in carriage and indeed in our experimental pneumococcal inoculations, only one healthy adult progressed to carriage. This result is surprising given that the inoculated dose per naris for both cohorts in our study ( Table 1 ) is similar (23F) or higher (6B) than the CFU dose described by McCool and Weiser  [25]  for their colonised (12,000±5,477/naris) and uncolonised (7,250±4,062/naris) groups. Colonisation success rate will depend on challenge dose but also on the sensitivity of detection, exposure to other non-/infectious agents, presence of co-morbidities, genetic factors, opacity (i.e. capsule expression) of the challenge strain  [45]  and study design.
The usefulness of the EHPC model depends on the sensitivity of assays for detection of carriage. Sample collection by nasal swab followed by enrichment for pneumococci using STGG medium and subsequent bacterial culture is the current gold standard method  [46] . A previous EHPC model used throat and nasal swab or wash with standard bacteriological culture media  [25] . We demonstrated that a NW sample is not only more comfortable for the volunteer but better than swabs for detecting upper respiratory flora  [30]  including pneumococcus  [47] . We employed a method combining NW collection and direct plating followed by storage in STGG broth at −80°C  [30] . A molecular approach to pneumococcal identification may yield greater sensitivity compared to culture  [48] ,  [49] , but it does not distinguish between carriage, which implies the presence of viable pneumococci, and retention of bacterial antigen from non-viable cells. A sophisticated molecular approach  [48]  will resolve these issues in the future but we cannot rule out that some volunteers described here were colonised below the detection limit of the current gold standard method. The major strength of this study, however, is that it focused on the immunological impact of a potentially infecting dose of pneumococcus  [25]  on healthy adults with proven previous natural pneumococcal exposure. We have been able to describe responses in the inoculated site (nasopharynx), distal airway and circulating blood.
The onset of carriage and acquisition of immunity in infants has been successfully modelled using mice. These models have shown that intra-nasal inoculation using live  [14] ,  [16] ,  [17] ,  [50]  or ethanol killed  [10]  pneumococci or recombinant proteins  [37] ,  [51] – [54]  (some with adjuvant) can elicit humoral and cellular immune responses that protect against subsequent colonisation  [14] ,  [16] – [18]  and/or disease  [16] ,  [17] . Murine models can dissect the relative contribution of humoral and cellular defence  [55]  but are a better model of infancy (naive response) than of adults with pre-existing memory responses. We have shown for the first time that levels of anti-protein IgG and IgA against pneumococus were boosted in both NW and BAL following intranasal challenge with pneumococci, though this depends on the serotype used. The implication of this finding is that exposure to low doses of pneumococcus is potentially immunising at the mucosal surface. A limitation of this study, however, is that the samples collected from the nasopharynx and lung are so dilute that functional measurement of the opsonophagocytic effect of the observed increase in immunoglobulin concentration is not currently possible. Previous studies in several laboratories including ours  [56]  have attempted to concentrate BAL in order to measure opsonic function. Concentration in this way allows binding to be determined but enhanced phagocytosis following immunisation has not been demonstrated.
It is interesting that there was no significant change in IgG or IgA to polysaccharide capsule following inoculation. This somewhat counter-intuitive observation is consistent with previous data showing a lack of BAL response to inhaled polysaccharide  [57] . Human experimental colonisation however enhanced serum polysaccharide responses in 5/6 volunteers  [25]  suggesting colonisation has a greater systemic immunising effect compared to challenge. Polysaccharide responses are initiated in the spleen and plasma cells are found in very low numbers in BAL. In the current study we know that bacterial clearance from the nasopharynx was achieved in less than 2 days (probably more rapidly) and it is therefore reasonable to suggest that polysaccharide and bacterial protein were not presented to critical sites or cells to enhance systemic immunity. IgG to polysaccharide capsule is a critical defence mechanism against invasive pneumococcal disease but is less important in defence against carriage  [18] . Our data suggest that experimental pneumococcal exposure without carriage does not augment this limb of systemic defence.
We showed altered mucosal responses to protein antigens, particularly choline bound proteins such as PspA. Using Western blot and whole cell ELISA, more IgG to pneumococcal protein was found after inoculation than before in both NW and BAL in the 23F cohort. The Western blots show a greater effect of inoculation on the choline binding proteins than on proteins extracted without choline chloride. Specific anti-protein ELISA was only able to detect a statistically significant difference in one of the 4 proteins tested (PspA) although NW IgG levels to the other three were all increased in the 6B challenged cohort. There are many pneumococcal surface-proteins that function as virulence factors and are sufficiently surface exposed to have vaccine potential. Some of these pneumococcal surface proteins, including PspA, PspC and PsaA, have been shown to have roles in adhesion and carriage and may vary in expression between pneumococcal isolates. Human anti-PspA responses elicited by intra-muscular vaccination with rPspA are protective against subsequent lethal challenge with heterologous pneumococci when passively transferred in murine models  [12]  and therefore the response seen in our 6B (NW) and 23F (BAL) cohort may be of functional significance. Both strains used in our study express PspA clade 1 similar to the PspA used for the ELISA. The absence of a NW response in the 23F cohort could be due to low PspA expression by the inoculated strain or adsorption of nasal antibodies to the inoculated bacteria. The concentration of IgG to PspA in mucosal samples is so diluted that direct functional assays or passive transfer experiments are unlikely to succeed. Alternatively, increased protection due to immunoglobulin responses in NW could be tested by repeated pneumococcal challenge of subjects with heterologous or homologous serotypes who develop experimental carriage and/or enhanced immunoglobulin responses on the first inoculation. This study is planned in our laboratory.
Murine models have demonstrated that pneumococcal colonisation or vaccination results in the generation of memory CD4 T and B cells in both the circulation and at the mucosa. The effector CD4 T cell phenotype is mixed but includes IL-17  [14] ,  [37] ,  [58]  and/or IFNγ  [37] ,  [51]  secreting T cells (T h-17 /T h-1 ). NW samples from healthy adults had very low cell counts in this study which is not surprising given that mucosal immune cells are found in specialised sub-mucosal lymphoid aggregates, best investigated in humans by using surgical explants  [59] . We were, however, able to demonstrate antigen-specific T cells producing cytokine in response to specific stimuli in BAL both before and after nasal inoculation. Pneumococcal challenge, however, did not alter the frequency of pneumococcal specific, cytokine secreting, CD4 T cells in BAL. The dose of pneumococci delivered to the lung in our non-colonised subjects is likely to have been very small and therefore the antigenic stimulus to lung during the inoculation period in our subjects will have been minimal. The lymphatic drainage of the nasopharynx is to the cervical lymph nodes whilst the lungs drain to the hilar nodes; we would therefore expect that antigen challenge of the nasopharynx would have limited impact on BAL lymphocytes. A recent murine model, however, has shown that viral upper respiratory tract infections lead to the migration of clonally-related populations of activated T cells to both upper  and  lower respiratory mucosal sites  [60] . These data suggests that measuring the proportion and phenotype of antigen specific T cells in the BAL mucosal compartment in humans may be similar to the proportion and phenotype of effector T cell populations present in the sub-mucosa of the nasopharynx. In this study, we observed an increased absolute count of BAL lymphocytes and increased percentage of CD4 memory cells in BAL at second examination in the 23F cohort. This may reflect a response of the respiratory tract to antigen challenge as it only occurred in the 23F cohort and this cohort also had significant immunoglobulin anti-pneumococcal protein responses following challenge. It is also possible that the altered CD4 profile seen in 5/6 subjects in that cohort resulted from the non-specific activation caused by a previous BAL but this effect was not seen in the 6B cohort. Alternatively, the proportion of memory CD4 T cells in the 23F cohort (pre challenge) is lower than that in the 6B cohort (pre challenge) and therefore the increased recruitment and proportion of memory CD4 T cells may reflect a return to homeostatic levels with concomitant recruitment of antibody secreting plasma cells. There were no increases in antigen-specific CD4 T cell functional assays to suggest specific pneumococcal activation. Current studies in our laboratory aim to characterise the BAL lymphocyte response to experimental human pneumococcal carriage which will provide a more sustained antigen challenge to the lung.
We used two different pneumococcal strains and two different protocols in the experimental inoculations of two consecutive cohorts of volunteers. The results in each cohort were similar in that capsular responses were not detected in any compartment and enhanced immunoglobulin responses were not observed in blood. The study design was modified between 23F and 6B cohorts in an attempt to obtain colonisation and is different from that published previously by McCool and Weiser  [25]  likely influencing the results observed. In our study whole cell ELISA data showed significant changes only in the 23F cohort and changes in anti-PspA response were only seen in the 23F cohort when comparing before and after inoculation. This is most likely due to the double dose challenge procedure employed in the 23F cohort compared to the 6B cohort. Two doses are employed to first prime the immune system to vaccine and then second to boost specific responses. This has been performed successfully using rPspA (with alum as adjuvant) in humans leading to 100 fold increases of serum anti-PspA IgG in volunteers immunized with 125 µg of rPspA  [12] . The rPspA given in this study, however, was intra-muscular and a larger dose. Mucosal sites were not examined for cellular or humoral responses. Differences between the 23F and 6B cohort described here in NW, BAL and serum cannot be ascribed to other confounding variables such as the after effects of BAL collection since this was obtained from both groups and non-specific activation would have to be maintained for at least 10 weeks before being detected in post samples. BAL collection before nasal exposure is a limitation of this study and is an important difference between our 23F challenge model and the model described by McCool and Weiser  [25] . BAL collection may cause systemic  [61]  and local  [62]  side effects but these are usually short term (1–2 days) rather than long term (weeks) effects. We attempted to minimise the pro-inflammatory effect of BAL collection by maintaining a 2 week gap between sample collection and challenge. We cannot rule out the possibility that BAL collection approximately 2 weeks before challenge may have impaired our ability to obtain colonisation following challenge with 23F and 6B compared to the success rate of McCool and Weiser  [25] .
The different results obtained from our 23F and 6B cohorts may also be due to different antigenicity of the PspA found in the two inoculated strains; although both strains used for inoculation express similar PspA as that used for ELISA (all clade 1). We are now manufacturing the PspA from each strain in order to improve detection sensitivity but the implication of this pattern of findings is that immunogenicity varies between natural exposures independent of capsular type. In addition, the concentration of specific antibody required for mucosal protection may differ between natural and experimental exposure.
These data suggest that a mean dose of  S. pneumoniae  of approximately 8,791 cfu/naris (1 st  dose), and 13,830 cfu/naris (second dose) of 23F or 44,576 cfu/naris of type 6B is sufficient to activate mucosal defence causing a sustained increase in pneumococcal specific IgG and IgA antibody to be detected in mucosal washes 6 weeks after challenge. Pneumococcal colonisation or higher doses of an attenuated strain may be required to elicit T cell and immunoglobulin mediated systemic immunity.
