Recruitment and human pneumococcal challenge
Twenty volunteers were recruited and inoculated per protocol as shown in  Figure 1  with no adverse effects. One subject in the 23F cohort established experimental colonisation as a result of the inoculation and is excluded from further description in this study. In the first cohort 8 subjects received two doses of 23F mean dose 8,791 cfu/naris (SD±1,935 cfu/naris) and 13,830 cfu/naris (SD±4,504 cfu/naris), given 2 weeks apart ( Figure 1 A  and  Table 1 ). In our second cohort we challenged 11 volunteers with a single, mean dose of 44,576 6B cfu/naris (SD±12,815 cfu/naris) ( Figure 1 B  and  Table 1 ). These remaining nineteen study volunteers did not establish colonisation following pneumococcal challenge, contrary to our initial expectations. We did not detect pneumococci in any nasal washes obtained from these nineteen volunteers. Details of the study participants who were challenged with pneumococci are given in  Table 1  for both 23F and 6B cohorts.
Nasal wash volumes recovered were a mean of 5.9 ml (range 2.3 to 8.5 ml) for the 23F cohort and 6.5 ml for the 6B cohort (range 4 to 8.1 ml). BAL volumes with cell counts are shown in  Table S1 .
Intra-nasal pneumococcal challenge increases mucosal pneumococcal specific IgG and IgA
Pneumococcal whole cell ELISA data were compared before and after pneumococcal challenge in 3 compartments (NW, BAL and serum) using samples from the first 7 volunteers for the 23F cohort and 8 volunteers in the 6B cohort as shown in  Figure 2 . Three volunteers were excluded from the 6B cohort as a full set of paired samples were not obtained. In each cohort, the relevant challenge pneumococcal strain was used as the ELISA target antigen. Whole cell ELISA using 23F and 6B pneumococcus detected antigen-specific IgG and IgA in all NW, BAL and serum samples both before and after inoculating challenge. Antigen-specific titers of pneumococcal specific IgG were much higher in serum than in NW (200-fold) or BAL (1000-fold). Similarly, serum levels of pneumococcal specific IgA were much higher than in NW (10-fold for 6B and 100-fold for 23F) and BAL (100-fold for 6B and 1000-fold for 23F). There was no association between volume of fluid returned and immunoglobulin titer for either NW or BAL samples.
Comparisons before and after nasal inoculation with bacteria showed that there was no change in pneumococcus-specific IgG or IgA in serum following inoculation with either 23F or 6B as shown in  Figures 2A and 2B . There was a significant increase in both IgG (pre 25.4±7.5 vs post 52.5±7.5, p = 0.05) and IgA titers (pre 47.5±17.9 vs post 122±57.6, p = 0.03) in NW following 23F inoculation, and a significant increase in IgA in NW following 6B inoculation (pre 36±14.4 vs post 58±15.9, p = 0.03) as shown in  Figures 2C and 2D . BAL data showed a significant increase in anti-pneumococcal IgG titer following 23F (pre 6±2.5 vs post 16.2±8.6, p = 0.03) but not 6B challenge ( Figure 2E ). Anti-pneumococcal IgA responses in BAL before and after 23F or 6B challenge were unaltered ( Figure 2F ). In summary, intranasal inoculation of bacteria was associated with increased NW (IgG and IgA) and BAL (IgG only) immunoglobulin responses but no change in serum levels. These observations were dependent on whether the challenge was with 23F (NW and BAL) or 6B (NW IgA only) pneumococcal serotype.
Increased pneumococcal specific IgG and IgA responses are directed towards pneumococcal proteins and not capsular polysaccharide
We next determined which pneumococcal antigenic targets were responsible for the increased antibody responses. We measured anti-23F or 6B capsular polysaccharide responses before and after challenge with the respective challenge strain in NW, BAL and serum. There were no significant differences in 23F or 6B anti-capsular polysaccharide responses before and after challenge in either cohort ( Figure S1  A–C).
We followed up our observations in  Figure 2 , showing a significant difference in IgG titer before and after 23F but not 6B challenge, by performing Western blots to compare IgG responses to 23F pneumococcal proteins on the same NW sample set.  Figure 3  shows results from NW taken from 8 subjects before ( Figure 3  Pre) and after ( Figure 3  Post) nasal challenge with 23F. There was more antigenic protein in each gel following CCE compared to WCE. The dominant protein antigen seen in all NW samples before challenge was a CCE band migrating to 110–150 kDa. Following challenge with 23F ( Figure 3  Post) there was a general increase in the overall level of NW antibody binding in both WCE and CCE lanes in all NW samples. There was particularly increased reactivity towards the 110–150 kDa band in all but one subjects and a new band slightly above 60 kDa in 5/8 donors ( Figure 3  Post). These data indicate an increase in IgG response towards pneumococcal proteins following 23F exposure.
Pneumococcal protein specific IgG is increased in NW following 6B but not 23F challenge
We next used purified proteins in an ELISA to quantitatively determine the specific pneumococcal proteins which elicited increased total pneumococcal specific IgG responses in NW following bacterial challenge. We measured anti-PspA, PspC, PdB and PsaA IgG ( Figure 4 ) levels in both 23F and 6B pneumococcal challenge cohorts before and after challenge. In the 23F challenge cohort we did not detect any difference in the concentration of anti-PspA ( Figure 4A ), PspC ( Figure 4B ), PdB ( Figure 4C ) or PsaA ( Figure 4D ) IgG before and after challenge. In the 6B challenge cohort, we detected a significant rise in the mean concentration of anti-PspA (pre 49.2±12.7 vs post 301.5±196.5, p = 0.05) ( Figure 4A ). The mean concentration of anti-PspC (pre 28.2±7.3 vs post 93.8±55.5, p = 0.07) ( Figure 4B ), anti-PdB (pre 2.3±0.8 vs post 21.4±15.12, p = 0.06) ( Figure 4C ) and anti-PsaA ( Figure 4D ) (pre 2.8±1.2 vs post 22.5±16.6, p = 0.1) antibody were all higher post 6B challenge compared to pre-challenge samples but these differences were not statistically significant. The Western blot and these ELISA data suggest that the antibody response to whole pneumococci extends beyond these 4 studied antigenic proteins.
Intra-nasal 23F pneumococcal challenge increases anti-PspA IgG in BAL
Bacterial challenge with type 23F pneumococcus was associated with increased BAL IgG titer in pneumococcal whole cell ELISA but not with increased anti-capsular BAL IgG. We therefore measured anti-pneumococcal protein IgG levels in BAL samples following 23F challenge. We measured anti-PspA, PspC, PdB and PsaA IgG responses in BAL ( Figure 5 ) for both challenge cohorts. There was a significant increase in the concentration of anti-PspA specific IgG in BAL following challenge with 23F (pre 96.4±32.2 vs post 161.7±57, p = 0.03) but not 6B ( Figure 5A ). A higher concentration of anti-PspC IgG in BAL following challenge with 23F (pre 37.9±10.7 vs post 90.2±32.3, p = 0.07) was observed ( Figure 5B ) but was not statistically significant. There were no differences in the concentration of anti-PdB ( Figure 5C ) and PsaA ( Figure 5D ) IgG in BAL before and after challenge with 23F. There were no differences in protein specific responses in BAL before and after 6B challenge ( Figure 5A–D ).
Pneumococcal 23F challenge decreases serum anti-PspA
Although there were no changes in serum observed following bacterial challenge using either whole cell ELISA or capsular polysaccharide ELISA, we measured anti-PspA, PspC, PdB and PsaA IgG in serum before and after challenge with 23F or 6B ( Figure 6 ). In contrast to the increased anti-PspA measured in BAL following 23F challenge there was a significant  decrease  in the concentration of serum anti-PspA following challenge with 23F (serum pre 125.6±42 vs serum post 76.9±14, p = 0.03) but not 6B ( Figure 6A ). The concentration of anti-PspC ( Figure 6B ), PdB ( Figure 6C ) and PsaA ( Figure 6D ) were similar before and after challenge for both 23F and 6B cohorts.
Pneumococcal challenge shows evidence of mild inflammation
We next compared the cellularity and cellular responses in NW samples obtained from subjects before and after pneumococcal challenge from both 23F (first dose only) and 6B cohorts.
NW sample cellularity was low and variable (range 0–9300 total cells) in samples collected. There was no difference in total cell yield before and after challenge for the 23F cohort ( Figure S2 ). Increased levels of cellular effectors (neutrophils and mononuclear cells) and/or granular mucus deposits (evidence of inflammation) compared to baseline were seen on cytospins of NW preparations in 4/8 volunteers 2 days after 23F challenge and in 2/8 volunteers at 4 days. IL-17 ELISA (eBioscience, UK, Catalogue 88-7176-22) performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on NW samples from 4 volunteers showed no detectable cytokine before and after 23F challenge. In the 6B cohort 5/7 samples showed increased cellular effectors and/or granular mucus deposits in samples taken immediately after 6B challenge compared with before challenge.
Pneumococcal challenge is associated with altered mucosal T cell memory in BAL but no increase in antigen-specific T cell responses before and after challenge
There were no differences in BAL volume and total cell yield before and after 23F or 6B challenge ( Table S1 ). In the cohort challenged with 23F, there was a significantly higher total lymphocyte count (mean±SD Pre 1.9±0.75×10 6  vs post 3.2±1.2×10 6  p = 0.006) after challenge compared to before in BAL. The percentage of total T cells that were of the memory CD4 phenotype was also significantly higher after challenge compared to before (mean%±SD, Pre 40.05±20.6 vs post 48.47±14.7, p = 0.048). Total BAL lymphocyte counts showed correlation with the BAL anti-23F whole cell antibody titre (p = 0.01, Pearson correlation) and anti-PspA concentration (p = 0.03, Pearson correlation) for the 23F but not the 6B cohort ( Figure S3 ). In the cohort challenged with 6B, there was no increase in total lymphocyte count, no increase in % memory CD4 T cells and no association of lymphocyte numbers with anti-pneumococcal IgG by whole cell ELISA ( Figure S3 ).
The data for antigen-specific T cell responses (baseline corrected) are shown in  Figure 7  as the percentage of memory CD4 T cells producing at least one cytokine (of IFN-γ, TNF or IL-17) before and after the subject was intra-nasally inoculated with pneumococci.
Antigen-specific responses, to influenza and pneumococcal preparations, compared to non-stimulated cells, were seen to a varying degree in blood and BAL from both cohorts  before  challenge. In the 23F cohort, significant antigen-specific responses (compared with non-stimulated control) were seen to influenza in BAL (mean%±SD, 0.85±0.66 vs non-stimulated 0.42±0.36 p = 0.03,  n  = 7) and blood (0.15±0.05 vs control 0.05±0.07, p = 0.03,  n  = 8). There were no significant responses to pneumococcal antigens before inoculation in blood or BAL but there were significant responses to 23 c/s  after  inoculation in BAL (0.55±0.28 vs vehicle 0.35±0.16, p = 0.032,  n  = 8).
In the 6B cohort, significant antigen-specific responses (compared to non-stimulated control) were seen to influenza in BAL (0.5±0.29 vs non-stimulated 0.19±0.09, p = 0.02) but not blood. We also detected significant responses to 6B whole pneumococci but not 6B culture supernatant in BAL (0.40±0.26 vs control 0.18±0.09 p = 0.05) before pneumococcal challenge. In blood we detected significant responses to 6B c/s (0.62±0.26 vs vehicle 0.24±0.09, p = 0.0020) but not 6B whole pneumococci before challenge.
Paired comparisons, before and after challenge, did not show any significant differences in the proportion of pneumococcal specific cytokine producing memory CD4 T cells before and after challenge with 23F ( Figure 7A  blood and 7B BAL) or 6B ( Figure 7C  blood and 7D BAL) in blood or BAL.
