Kv10.1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 1, also known as Ether-à-go-go 1, EAG1; encoded by the  KCNH1  gene) is a voltage-gated potassium channel [ 1 ] almost exclusively expressed in the mammalian central nervous system [ 2 ], where it regulates neuronal excitability at high stimulus frequencies [ 3 ]. However, the functional conservation from cnidarians to humans [ 4 ] suggests that Kv10.1 may also serve other functions. Kv10.1 was among the early examples of potassium channels implicated in tumor progression. It increases the growth and aggressiveness of implanted tumors in mice [ 5 ]. Over 70% of solid human tumors are Kv10.1-positive, which correlates with an unfavorable prognosis [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ]. In contrast, inhibition of the channel reduces tumor cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, making Kv10.1 a promising target for cancer therapy [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ]. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which Kv10.1 favors cell proliferation and enhances tumor progression are poorly understood.
We have previously shown that, in non-neural cells, Kv10.1 localizes to the centrosomes and primary cilia [ 21 ], and that its expression occurs only during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle [ 22 ]. Downregulation of Kv10.1 induces accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase, suggesting that cells depleted of Kv10.1 require a longer time to complete G2/M, which implies the participation of the channel in the regulation of this phase of the cell cycle [ 22 ].
The successful completion of each step of the cell cycle is monitored by checkpoints, which block progression to the next stage until the quality criteria of the preceding one are met [ 23 ]. Two checkpoints function in G2 and M phases—DNA damage-induced checkpoint and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), respectively [ 23 ]. The DNA damage-induced checkpoint utilizes the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase)/ATR (ATM and Rad3 related kinase)—CHK2 (checkpoint kinase 2)/CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1)—CDC25 (cell division cycle protein 25) axis, which configures the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery [ 24 ]. This checkpoint inhibits the complex cyclin B/CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1), precluding the initiation of mitosis and providing sufficient time for DNA repair [ 23 ].
SAC delays the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindle in a bipolar fashion [ 25 ]. The biorientation of chromosomes occurs in a stochastic process—constant removal of incorrect kinetochore-microtubule connections and stabilization of those producing the required tension is the basis for achieving biorientation [ 25 , 26 ]. Hence, the process depends on the regulation of microtubule (MT) growth and shrinkage. The central effector of SAC is the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which consists of MAD2 (mitotic arrest deficient 2), BUB3 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 3 homolog), and BUBR1 (BUB1-related protein 1) [ 25 ]. MCC is recruited by kinetochores not attached to MTs and sequesters CDC20 (cell division cycle protein 20), hindering the activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) [ 25 ]. Completion of the biorientation of chromosomes results in the inactivation of SAC, granting APC/C to initiate the anaphase.
The activation of kinases and phosphatases is not the only regulatory mechanism for progression through the cell cycle; changes in cytosolic ion composition are also essential for the process [ 27 , 28 ]. Transient changes in cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] accompany the progression through different phases of the cell cycle [ 29 , 30 , 31 ], for example, during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition [ 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ]. Moreover, Ca 2+  ions can modulate the MT dynamics either directly or indirectly through changes in the protein make-up of MT-tips [ 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 ]. Therefore, the oscillations in cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] during G2/M will induce changes in MT dynamics.
We designed this study to explore the status of the checkpoints regulating the G2 and M-phases in the absence of Kv10.1. Since it was recently proposed that Kv10.1 and the Ca 2+  channel ORAI1 (calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1) cooperate functionally to control Ca 2+  influx [ 41 ], we studied whether Kv10.1 plays a role in providing the appropriate [Ca 2+ ] for MT growth during spindle formation. We show that Kv10.1 downregulation leads to activation of SAC, preventing the formation of lagging chromosomes, commonly observed in cancer cells. The phenotype which we describe here partially depends on the functional interaction with ORAI1. Together with ORAI1, Kv10.1 changes the cytosolic Ca 2+  behavior and, consequently, MT dynamics during mitosis. Besides, Kv10.1 influences the MT dynamics independently and opposite to its conducting properties, suggesting a dual effect of the channel on MT behavior.
