3.1. Cell Lines
HeLa cells (DSMZ ACC 57) were maintained in RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium) 1640 (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) as recommended by the supplier. hTERT-RPE1 (ATCC CRL 4000) were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.01 mg/mL hygromycin. No antibiotics were used during the experiments. For the imaging experiments, the cells were plated onto fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany)-coated coverslips (#1.5, Paul Marienfeld, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany) in six-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) or glass-bottom four-well μ-ibidi (#1.5, Ibidi, Gräfelfing, Germany) imaging plates.
3.2. Transfections
Transient downregulation of Kv10.1 in HeLa and hTERT RPE1 cells was carried out using Interferin (Polyplus-transfection, New York, NY, USA) transfection reagent according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Co-transfection of siRNA and pEB3-tdTomato (end-binding protein 3 tandem dimer tomato fluorescent protein; a gift from Erik Dent; plasmid #50708, Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA; [ 104 ]) was performed with jetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus-transfection, Polyplus-transfection, New York, NY, USA). In all cases, the final concentration of siRNAs was 30 nM, and the following sequences of siRNAs were used:  KCNH1 , 5′-TACAGCCATCTTGGTCCCTTA-3′ (HP Custom siRNA, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany);  Scr  (Silencer negative control siRNA #1, Ambion, Kaufungen, Germany).
The co-expression of the hEAG1-ptracer (pKCNH1-WT; [ 5 ]) and pEB3-tdTomato in HeLa and hTERT RPE1 cells was achieved using the jetPRIME transfection reagent following the manufacturer’s guidelines.
3.3. Cell Cycle Synchronization
Depending on the experiment, HeLa cells were synchronized at various stages of the cell cycle. When needed, 4 h before the synchronization, the cells were transfected with the corresponding siRNAs.
Changes in proteins of interest over time were studied in HeLa cells synchronized at the G1/S border by growing the cells for two periods of 16 h with excess thymidine (2 mM; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and 8 h release in-between. The cells blocked at G1/S were then transferred into fresh growth medium, and cell samples were collected every 2 h between 0 to 6 h and 10 to 14 h, and every hour between 6 to 10 h (G2/M phase). The samples were then used for immunoblot experiments.
For metaphase and anaphase synchronization, the cells were treated only once with 2 mM thymidine for 16 h, then rinsed twice with DPBS (Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and released in fresh growth medium for 4 h. Subsequently, the cells were exposed to 2 ng/mL nocodazole for 4 h and washed again with DPBS as before. The cells were harvested either at this stage (for PLK1 activity) or synchronized further. For the anaphase, the cells were released for 40 min into a standard growth medium. In the case of metaphase, the cells were further incubated with 15 µM MG132 for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 .
Monopolar spindles were produced by treating asynchronously growing HeLa cells with 2.5 µM DME (dimethylenastron; Calbiochem, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . The cells were then either immediately fixed and used for immunofluorescence or imaged within two hours.
For intracellular calcium imaging, HeLa cells were synchronized at the G2/M border by a double thymidine protocol followed by a release into a fresh growth medium for 7.5 h.
3.4. Protein Extracts
Proteins were extracted from the synchronized cell pellets with a non-denaturing lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) for 30 min at room temperature (RT) in 1:3 ratio (volume-to-volume, v:v). Nuclear proteins were extracted with lysis buffer containing 1% (v:v) NP-40, 0.1% (weight-to-volume, w:v) Na-deoxycholate, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors. The lysates were centrifuged at 18,000×  g  for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) assay calibrated with BSA (bovine serum albumin provided with the kit) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Protein samples (50 μg) were denatured by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min with the NuPAGE Reducing agent (1:10, v:v; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the NuPAGE LDS Sample buffer (1:4, v:v; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
3.5. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting
Low and mid-range molecular weight proteins were resolved in 4–12% NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris Mini Gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 200 V in NuPAGE MOPS electrophoresis buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and blotted onto 0.2 µm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 50 V for 2 h at RT in 10 mM NaHCO 3 , 3 mM Na 2 CO 3 , 0.01% SDS (w:v), and 20% methanol (v:v) transfer buffer. High molecular weight proteins were separated in 3–8% NuPAGE Novex Tris-acetate Gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in Tris-acetate electrophoresis buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 150 V, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 µm, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) by 10 mM NaHCO 3 , 3 mM Na 2 CO 3 , 0.01% SDS, and 15% methanol transfer buffer at 35 V and 4 °C, overnight. After transfer, the membranes were rinsed with distilled water and treated with Western Blot Signal Enhancer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Non-specific binding was blocked for 90 min with either 0.1% casein (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) or 5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) in TBS (Tris-buffered saline, 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies ( Table 2 ) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, the membranes were exposed to HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-coupled secondary antibody ( Table 2 ) in blocking buffer for 45 min. Proteins were detected by incubating with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for 5 min and protected from light. The signal was detected with a ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Feldkirchen, Germany) controlled by the Quantity One 1-D Analysis software v4.6.9 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Ten images were acquired between 1 s and 10 min of exposure or until saturation was reached. In some cases, the membranes were stripped using Restore Plus Western Blot stripping buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) for 30 min and reused after blocking if no signal was detected in a 5 min exposure after incubating with HRP chemiluminescence substrate.
Changes in expression of the protein of interest were estimated by densitometry analysis using the ImageLab software version 4.1 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) using the intensity profile of each lane and normalizing the volume intensity of the bands to the corresponding value for actin.
3.6. Immunoprecipitation
The scarce expression of Kv10.1 in HeLa and hTERT RPE1 cells made it necessary that the efficiency of knockdown was tested by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Kv10.1 monoclonal antibody (Kv10.1-33.mAb), and recovery with protein G magnetic beads (New England BioLabs, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions ( Figure S3 ). The beads were washed three times with 500 µL of cold immunoprecipitation buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and protease inhibitor cocktail) and Kv10.1 was eluted at 70 °C for 10 min in NuPAGE LDS Sample buffer (1:4, v:v).
3.7. Single-Cell Gel Electrophoresis
DNA lesions were detected by alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) [ 105 ]. Cells were plated in a six-well plate, transfected with siRNA one day later and assayed after 48 h. All the steps were carried out under dim light and at 4 °C. The assay was performed in clean CometSlide 2 Well (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) slides coated with 0.5% normal melting point agarose, on which 15,000 cells/well in 1% low melting point agarose were layered. The slides were incubated in lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl; 0.1 M EDTA; 10 mM Tris, 10% DMSO, v:v; 1% Triton X-100, v:v; pH, 10) for 1 h, placed in cold electrophoresis buffer (1 mM Na 2 EDTA; 300 mM NaOH; pH > 13) and denatured for 20 min. The electrophoresis was carried out for 20 min at 13 V (0.6 V/cm across the platform) and 300 mA. The slides were neutralized (0.4 M Tris; pH, 7.5) for 10 min and then fixed in ethanol, air-dried overnight, and stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Ten positions in each well of the still-wet slides were imaged on a Nikon TiE-Andor spinning disk microscope (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK) equipped with a PLAN APO VC Air 20× 0.75 NA objective (Nikon Instruments, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Images were acquired with an Andor DU-888 X-9984 camera controlled with the NIS-Elements AR software v.4.50 (Nikon Instruments, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Maximum intensity projections of z-stack images with 0.2 µm z-step size were analyzed using CASPLab open-source software [ 106 ].
3.8. Immunofluorescence
To visualize mitotic spindles and kinetochores, cells seeded on coverslips were fixed with 2%  p -formaldehyde, 60 mM PIPES, 27 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgSO 4 , pH, 7.0 for 5 min at RT, followed by methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. After blocking for 90 min in 10% BSA in DPBST (0.1% Tween-20), the cells were incubated for 2 h at RT with anti-α-tubulin, anti- CENP-B (centromere protein B), or anti-γ-tubulin (see  Table 3  for dilutions and specifications), followed by a one-hour incubation with the secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor-488, -546 or -633, respectively. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at RT, washed three times with DPBST for 5 min at RT, and mounted using Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). The slides were imaged on a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with HCX PL APO Oil 40× 1.25 NA objective. Images were acquired with a z-optical spacing of 0.2 µm using LAS AF (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) software, and processed with the image analysis software ImageJ2 [ 107 , 108 , 109 ] (U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and Imaris (Bitplane, Oxford Instruments, Belfast, UK).
3.9. Determination of Fan-Shaped Mitotic Spindles
The occurrence of asymmetric (fan-shaped) mitotic spindles was determined in HeLa cells synchronized in prometaphase with DME 48 h post-siRNA transfection. Defective mitotic spindles were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy detecting microtubules and DNA. The occurrence of fan-shaped mitotic spindles was defined as a percentage of the defective spindles from the total number of monopolar mitotic spindles.
3.10. Determination of Lagging Chromosomes and Defective Metaphases
To detect lagging chromosomes in anaphase, HeLa cells were transfected with  Scr - or  KCNH1 -siRNAs, and the synchronization with thymidine-nocodazole was started 4 h later. Cells were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy detecting CENP-B-positive chromosomes. Only chromosomes that were both CENP-B-positive and separated from the two pole-oriented chromosome masses were counted as “lagging chromosomes”.
The defective metaphases were defined in the cells synchronized at metaphase and stained for α-tubulin, CENP-B, Hoechst 33342. Using Hoechst 33342 and CENP-B staining, the alignment of chromosomes was analyzed.
3.11. Determination of Mitotic Spindle Angle
Mitotic spindle angle and the distance between the poles were measured using Imaris v9.0 in HeLa cells synchronized at metaphase and stained for γ- and α-tubulin. Two spheres with a diameter of 1.5 µm around the maximum intensity of γ-tubulin were generated at the centrosomes. A third sphere was positioned as a projection of one of the centrosomes at the z-level of the opposite centrosome.
3.12. Determination of the Polo-Like Kinase 1 Enzymatic Activity
PLK1 activity was measured in lysates from cells synchronized at G1/S and prophase using CycLex Polo-like kinase 1 Assay/Inhibitor Screening Kit (MBL International Corporation, Woburn, MA, USA). The reaction was started by addition of 180 µL of Kinase Reaction Buffer to 20 µL cell lysates (50 µg protein) in microtiter wells coated with recombinant Protein-X as PLK1 substrate (CycLex Kit) and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. The rest of the steps were performed according to the instructions in the kit protocol. Only lysis buffer was used as a negative control and 0.2 mU of purified recombinant PLK1—as a positive control. All samples were prepared in duplicates. The absorbance in each well was measured using dual wavelengths at 450/540 nm on a Wallac 1420 VICTOR2 microplate reader (Wallac Distribution GmbH, Freiburg, Germany).
3.13. Proximity Ligation Assay
The interaction of Kv10.1 and ORAI1 in asynchronously growing HeLa cells was assessed with the Duolink PLA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions using anti-Kv10.1 (mAb62; 1:2000, mouse monoclonal) and anti-ORAI1 (Alomone Biolabs; 1:200, rabbit polyclonal) antibodies and imaged with a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope equipped with HCX PL APO Oil 40× 1.25 NA objective.
3.14. Live Cell Imaging
All time-lapse imaging experiments were performed on a Nikon TiE-Andor spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a PLAN APO-TIRF 100× 1.49 NA oil immersion objective. Images were acquired with an Andor DU-888 X-9984 camera controlled with NIS-Elements software.
3.15. Assessment of Microtubule Dynamics
Microtubule plus-end assembly rates were determined by tracking EB3-tdTomato in living cells. HeLa and hTERT RPE1 cells were transfected with pEB3-tdTomato alone or in combination with siRNAs. 48 h later, the cells were treated with 2.5 µM DME in a phenol-red free medium for 3.5 h, and transferred to the environmental control chamber of the microscope (37 °C and 5% CO 2 ) and further incubated until a total incubation time of 4 h. Throughout the entire experiment, the temperature was maintained constant at 37 °C. Images were acquired with 500 ms intervals for 1 min. EB3-tdTomato was excited using the 561 nm laser line, and the emission was collected with a 600/52 emission filter. The MT dynamics were analyzed with U-Track 2.2.0 following the authors’ guidelines [ 110 , 111 , 112 ].
3.16. Intracellular Calcium Imaging in HeLa Cells
Fluctuations in cytosolic [Ca 2+ ] were monitored in HeLa cells synchronized at the G2/M phase using Fluo-4AM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [ 113 ]. After 6.5 h of release from the second block with thymidine, the cells were incubated with 10 µM Fluo-4AM in phenol-red free DMEM medium for 50 min, and then the medium was replaced, and image acquisition was performed at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Image acquisition started at 60 min after the addition of Fluo4-AM at five positions per well for 2 h every 10 s.
In each recorded image, ten cells were manually selected as regions of interest (ROIs; in total, 50 cells per condition), and three background ROIs of constant size were identified. The intensity values in each ROI were measured over time with the NIS-Elements software. The corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) for each ROI and time point was calculated as a difference of the cell integrated intensity and the product of multiplication of the area of the selected cell and the mean background fluorescence. The generated CTCF values were further analyzed using MATLAB. In the time domain, a linear function was fitted to the collected data to compensate for the baseline drift resulting from photobleaching. The baseline was then subtracted from the measured values, generating normalized CTCFs. Additionally, to make the collected data comparable between experiments, the values were expressed as a percent change to the respective time-point “0”. The area under the curve (AUC), prominence, and full width at half maximum (FWHM) were calculated using trapz and findpeaks functions. Further, the time domain was transformed into a frequency domain by applying a Fast Fourier Transformation. The two-sided, and then the single-sided spectra were computed. The frequencies were sorted after power spectrum density (PSD) in descending order, and the first 15 values were used to calculate the weighted average frequency, defined as a mean of the product of frequency and the respective PSD.
3.17. Statistical Analysis
All data were analyzed using Prism software v8.4.3 (GraphPad Software LLC, San Diego, CA, USA). The analysis used for each experiment is indicated in the corresponding Figure legend. Data are shown as the median with interquartile range or the mean with standard error (SEM).  p -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
