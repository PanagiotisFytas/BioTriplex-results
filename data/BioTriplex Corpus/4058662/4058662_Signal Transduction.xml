Pathways and Effector Systems Elicited Following Cannabinoid Receptor Activation
Cannabinoid agonists interact primarily with two subtypes of receptors: the CB1 and CB2 receptors. CB1 receptors are expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems [ 52 - 56 ] the pituitary gland [ 57 ] the gastrointestinal tract [ 58 , 59 ] and the immune system [ 60 , 61 ]. While at first CB2 receptors were believed to be expressed primarily in cells and tissues comprising the immune system [ 62 , 63 ], they have since been localized in the brainstem and mediobasal hypothalamus [ 64 , 65 ]. Both receptor subtypes also are found to varying degrees in pre- and post-meiotic male gametes [ 66 ], and in the preimplantation embryo [ 67 ]. Thus the degree of overlap in the distribution of these receptors is greater than originally thought.
As mentioned briefly above, CB1 and CB2 receptors are metabotropic, G i/0 -coupled receptors, and when activated by endogenous or exogenous cannabinoids they trigger dissociation of the heterotrimer and a reduction in adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, cAMP production and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation [ 67 - 71 ]. This fundamental step in CB1 and CB2 receptor signaling is instrumental for a number of different effector pathways regulated by cannabinoids. At the cellular level, CB1 receptors modulate stimulus-secretion coupling, as well as neuronal excitability through both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. For example, cannabinoid agonists presynaptically inhibit glutamatergic synaptic currents in hippocampal cultures [ 72 ], as well as in many other brain regions including, but not limited to, prefrontal cortex [ 73 ] periaqueductal gray [ 74 ], striatum [ 75 ], cerebellum [ 76 ] and mediobasal hypothalamus [ 77 , 78 ]. They also presynaptically inhibit GABAergic synaptic currents in the rostral ventromedial medulla [ 79 ], corpus striatum [ 80 ], hippocampus [ 54 , 55 ] and substantia nigra [ 81 ]. In addition, cannabinoids presynaptically inhibit norephinephrine release from postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings [ 52 ]. Moreover, they decrease prolactin release from lactotroph-derived GH4C1 cells [ 82 ]. These effects can be attributed to the CB1 receptor-mediated decrease in Ca 2+  influx through high-threshold (e.g., N-type, P/Q-type, R-type) Ca 2+  channels as has been documented in AtT20 cells transfected with the CB1 receptor [ 83 ], NG108-15 cells [ 84 , 85 ], GH4C1 cells [ 82 ], cerebellar Purkinje cells [ 86 ] and calyx synapses in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body [ 87 ]. Interestingly, the release of endogenous cannabinoids caused by depolarization of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, cerebellar Purkinje cells, mesolimbic dopamine neurons, serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons and hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone neurons can inhibit GABA and/or glutamate release in a retrograde, trans-synaptic manner by phenomena known as the depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) [ 88 - 92 ] and excitation (DSE) [ 92 - 96 ] respectively. Moreover, the glucocorticoid-induced suppression of glutamatergic input into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is mediated  via  the retrograde actions of endogenous cannabinoids released from parvocellular neurosecretory cells [ 97 - 99 ]. Postsynaptically, cannabinoids augment the A-type K +  current (I A ) in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and in cultured hippocampal neurons by shifting the inactivation curves to the right in an adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA-dependent manner [ 100 - 103 ]. They also inhibit the M-type K +  current in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons [ 104 ]. In addition, cannabinoids activate an inwardly-rectifying K +  conductance AtT20 cells [ 83 ], in oocytes co-expressing the rat brain CB1 receptor and the G-protein gated inwardly-rectifying K +  channel GIRK1 [ 105 ], and in POMC neurons [ 78 ]. Collectively, these findings suggest that cannabinoids decrease stimulus-secretion coupling, and electrochemical transmission between neurons  via  presynaptic, trans-synaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.
Cannabinoid receptor activation may also elicit a number of other, different signal transduction pathways. For example, the cannabinoid-induced decrease in AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activity in adipose tissue and liver facilitates lipogenesis and attenuates gluconeogenesis [ 106 ]. In addition, Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) reduces nitric oxide production in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or interferon-γ [ 69 ]. On the other hand, it elevates intracellular Ca 2+  levels in splenic T lymphocytes and HPB-ALL cells but not in Jurkat E6-1 cells expressing dysfunctional CB2 receptors [ 60 ]. Activation of CB1 and CB2 receptors also induces Erk 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in microglia [ 107 , 108 ], whereas activation of CB2 but not CB1 receptors stimulates this pathway in spermatogonia [ 66 ]. This vast array of CB1 and CB2 receptor-mediated signal transduction mechanisms undoubtedly contributes to the diverse biological processes influenced by cannabinoids such as learning and memory, antinociception, motor function, energy balance, stress, thermoregulation, reproduction, drug reward and immunomodulation.

Hormonal and Neuromodulatory Influences on the Cannabinoid System
Endogenous cannabinoid biosynthesis and cannabinoid receptor-mediated signal transduction is altered by a number of hormones and neuromodulators, and nowhere is this more apparent than with regard to the cannabinoid regulation of energy homeostasis (see also next section). For example, the expression of CB1 receptors in vagal afferents innervating the stomach and duodenum is increased by fasting and decreased by the satiety hormone cholecystokinin [ 59 ]. The anorexigenic hormone leptin decreases hypothalamic concentrations of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), whereas orexigenic ghrelin increases the amount of 2-AG [ 109 , 110 ]. In addition, leptin blocks the glucocorticoid-induced increase in endogenous cannabinoid production in the PVN, whereas ghrelin's hyperphagic effect is ablated in CB1 receptor knockout mice [ 110 , 111 ]. Cannabinoids also regulate POMC gene expression in a sexually differentiated manner [ 112 ]. The cannabinoid-induced hyperphagia and hypothermia observed in guinea pigs is sexually disparate; with males being more responsive than females [ 113 ]. The latter is associated with differential presynaptic inhibition of GABAergic input onto POMC neurons [ 113 ], as well as discrepant activation of GIRK and the I A  in these cells [ 78 , 102 ]. These observations are in keeping with sex differences observed in β-endorphin knockout mice, in which males exhibit a more pronounced hyperphagia and resultant obesity with  ad libitum  access to food, as compared to their female counterparts [ 114 , 115 ]. Estrogens further diminish sensitivity to the hyperphagic and hypothermic effects of cannabinoids in females, which can be attributed, at least in part, to the rapid and sustained attenuation of the cannabinoid-induced presynaptic inhibition of glutamatergic input onto POMC neurons, as well as the cannabinoid-induced activation of the I A  [ 103 , 116 ]. Thus, the regulation of energy balance is replete with examples of how hormones and neuromodulators can “fine-tune” cannabinoid input onto this system.
