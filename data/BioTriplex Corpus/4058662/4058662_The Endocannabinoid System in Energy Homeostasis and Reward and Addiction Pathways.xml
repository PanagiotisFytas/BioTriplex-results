Endocannabinoid System and Energy Balance
The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is critically involved in the central and peripheral regulation of energy balance. It is strategically located in all the key points involved in food intake and energy expenditure. Thus, it is perhaps one of the few that can coordinate all the players involved in energy balance [ 1 , 117 ].
The peripheral ECS regulates energy balance mainly by helping to control the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and also it seems to modulate the secretion of important hormones such as insulin, glucagon and adiponectin (reviewed in [ 16 , 118 ]). Endocannabinoids and CB1 receptors are expressed in the gut, the liver, white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and pancreas, and as such the ECS is poised to play an integral role in regulating gut synthesis of orexigenic and anorexigenic factors as well as gastrointestinal motility and secretion, lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis (reviewed in [ 16 ]). Whereas the functional relevance of the ECS in gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscle and pancreas still deserves more investigation, its role in the adipose tissue and liver is better established. The ECS in adipose tissue regulate not only the enzymes involved in lipolysis and lipogenesis [ 119 , 120 ], but also adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes [ 121 ] and even transdifferentiation of adipocytes to mitochondria-enriched brown adipocytes [ 122 , 123 ]. In the liver, CB1 signaling promotes lipid synthesis and, especially under high fat diet, the development of liver steatosis, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance [ 124 , 125 ].
Centrally the ECS appears to control food intake  via  complex interactions between the hypothalamus, limbic system [ 138 ] and brain stem. The hypothalamus is a key brain structure in energy homeostasis because of its ability to integrate signals from central and peripheral tissues and cells. The hypothalamic feeding circuitry consists of orexigenic elements in the lateral hypothalamic area, which harbors orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) somata [ 126 , 127 ], and in the arcuate nucleus where neuropeptide Y (NPY)-/agouti-related peptide (AgRP)- and ghrelin-containing neurons are located [ 126 , 128 , 129 ]. On the other hand, the ventromedial nucleus functions as a prominent satiety center [ 130 , 131 ], and the arcuate nucleus houses the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons that express the posttranslational byproducts α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and β-endorphin, as well as cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) [ 114 , 132 , 133 ]. The latter is also found within neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area, as well as in the dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei [ 120 ]. In addition, anorexigenic corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus receive afferent signals from the other components of this neuronal feeding network, and therefore serve as a point of convergence and synaptic integration in formulating an efferent response [ 133 ]. Many of these neurons respond directly to circulating nutrients such as glucose, fatty acids and amino acids, and hormones such as insulin, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, cholecystokinin, peptide YY, and adrenal and gonadal steroids [ 111 , 129 , 134 - 138 ]. Finally, these humoral factors influence cell excitability by signaling through a variety of different enzymatic cascades including, but not limited to, phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the JAK/STAT pathway [ 111 , 136 - 140 ]. These hormonal and nutrient mediators, along with their signal transduction pathways, effects on neuronal activity and gene transcription as well as energy balance, are highlighted in  Table 2 .
CB1 receptors are distributed in the nuclei comprising the hypothalamic feeding circuitry, and they modulate the release and expression of orexigenic or anorexigenic signals [ 1 ]. Cannabinoid agonists focally administered into the ventromedial nucleus stimulate energy intake [ 141 ]. Endogenous cannabinoids also act in the lateral hypothalamic area, where they decrease GABAergic input onto melanin concentrating hormone neurons  via  DSI [ 91 ]. While cannabinoids have been reported to increase the hypothalamic release of NPY [ 142 ], CB1 receptor antagonism reduces food intake in NPY-deficient mice with the same efficacy as it does in wild-type controls [ 109 ]; suggesting that NPY neurons do not play a vital role in the cannabinoid regulation of appetite [ 1 ]. And although anorexigenic POMC neurons do not appear to contribute to the appetite-modulating properties of cannabinoids in agouti-related peptide over-expressing A y  mice [ 143 ], cannabinoids do presynaptically inhibit convergent glutamatergic and GABAergic input onto enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing POMC neurons [ 77 ]. A very important signal in the hypothalamus is leptin, an anorexigenic adipokine whose levels are related to the amount of fat stored. Leptin inhibits endocannabinoid production in the hypothalamus [ 109 ], thus decreasing food intake. Conversely, hypothalamic endocannabinoids are increased in genetically obese rodents lacking leptin or its receptor, and treatment of these mice with a CB1 antagonist attenuates the hyperphagia [ 109 ]. Also, the orexigenic action of glucocorticoids within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus is modulated through retrograde CB1-dependent signaling [ 144 ].
The limbic system is also involved in energy balance because it controls motivated behaviors (see also next section). There is increasing evidence supporting an interaction between mesolimbic reward pathways and the endocannabinoid system to control food intake [ 145 ]. It is known that CB1 receptors are expressed in presynaptic glutamatergic and GABAergic nerve terminals in the ventral tegmental area and endocannabinoids are synthesized by ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons, having a role in the fine-tuned regulation of these cells [ 146 ]. And while it is still unclear exactly what cell populations express CB1 receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), it seems that endocannabinoids within this area are capable of increasing food intake in a CB1-dependent manner [ 147 ]. Additional studies have also reported that endocannabinoids acting in the NAc modulate the palatability of food [ 148 ]. Interestingly, the NAc shell sends projections directly to the lateral hypothalamus (LH), thus suggesting its relationship with a hypothalamic area regulating food intake [ 149 ]. This relationship could be functionally mediated by the ECS. In fact, anandamide administration into the NAc shell activates several hypothalamic nuclei, including the LH, the dorsomedial nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus [ 150 ]. Another possibility is that the increase in endocannabinoids within the NAc shell might enhance pleasure from food. These observations suggest that food activates common neuronal circuits that are also involved in other motivated behaviors like sex and abuse of drugs (see next section). In the brainstem, another brain area involved in food intake, cannabinoids inhibit synaptic transmission in the dorsal vagal complex and rostral ventrolateral medulla, and decrease the firing of glucose-sensitive neurons in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius [ 79 , 151 , 152 ].
3.2.
Endocannabinoid System and Reward and Addiction Pathways
The reward system is a group of brain structures which regulate and control behaviour by inducing pleasurable effects. It is composed of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), medial forebrain bundle (MFB), NAc, ventral pallidum (VP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The major rewarding pathway in the brain is the mesolimbic pathway and goes from the VTA  via  the medial forebrain bundle to NAc, which is the primary release site for the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is considered the main brain's pleasure chemical and acts on D1 or D2 receptors to either stimulate (D1) or inhibit (D2) the production of cAMP. Among these structures, the NAc and VTA play a critical role in addiction because the NAc (along with the amygdala and PFC) is involved in the establishment of reward-associated memories in humans [ 183 ] and the VTA contains the perikarya of the mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons (see [ 184 ] for review). They are also involved in the negative experiences of drug withdrawal and abstinence (see [ 146 ] for review).
Drug addiction is a chronic brain disorder characterized by complex behavioural and neurobiological changes and processes that leads to drug seeking and loss of control over drug consumption [ 146 ]. Addiction is the progression from impulsive to compulsive behaviour of drug taking and it occurs in three stages: (1) binge/intoxication; (2) withdrawal/negative affect; and (3) preoccupation/anticipation. It is thought that these stages feed-back positively with each other, worsening the situation and leading to the final pathologic state [ 185 ]. All the drugs of abuse produce pleasurable, learning and reinforcing effects at the first stages (acute use), followed by the neurobiological changes that lead to dependence, addiction and sensitization during the chronic abuse phase, and finally the neuroplasticity phenomenon that give rise to physiological symptoms and craving through the withdrawal state. However, there are also other components including the negative effects of drug abstinence and withdrawal underlying the maintenance of addiction (see [ 146 ] for review). Drugs bind to membrane receptors to produce the different physiological and behavioural effects; however, all drugs of abuse share certain processes, brain circuits and neurobiological mechanisms after acute and chronic use [ 146 , 186 , 187 ].
ECS contributes to the regulation of “normophysiologic” reward [ 183 ] that includes sexual activity, nursing, social interactions, play activity and hedonic food intake and, interestingly, these incentive behaviours activate the same brain reward pathways as drugs of abuse [ 18 ]. For many years, the dopaminergic pathways and the opioid pathways have been considered as the main systems in mediating reward aspects [ 187 ]; however the use of pharmacological or genetic blockage of CB1 receptors and the measurement of the levels of AEA and 2-AG after the activation of reward processes in some recent studies ([ 187 ] for review), support the involvement of ECS in reward pathways and drug addiction (see [ 146 ] for review).
The ECS regulates motivation and incentive behaviours through interactions with the mesolimbic pathways and it appears that the control of this reward tone is mainly mediated by CB1 receptors. These receptors are present on axon terminals in reward structures and modulate inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents impinging upon mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons (see [ 18 , 146 , 187 ]). The presence of CB1 receptors in other structures related to reward pathways like the basolateral amygdala, hippocampus (related to memories), hypothalamus (involved in food intake) and cingulate cortex (implicated in learning and cognition) also contributes to this function of the ECS (Maldonado 2006). These receptors also modify the firing rate of the GABAergic neurons [ 18 ] and glutamatergic neurons [ 188 ] in the NAc, prelimbic cortex and hippocampus, thereby promoting long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) [ 146 ], drug-related memories and memory-related plasticity phenomenon [ 189 ]. In particular, CB1 receptors seem to play a fundamental role in mediating reinstatement of previously extinguished drug-seeking behavior upon re-exposure to the drug or drug-associated cues [ 189 ]
As it is already described, the CB1 receptor is critical for the persistence of the psychostimulant substances addiction [ 189 ]. Its main ligand is AEA and the key enzyme for AEA metabolism is the FAAH. Indeed, there are many studies showing that this enzyme is highly involved in the mechanism of action and reward pathways activated by different drugs of abuse like alcohol [ 190 ], cocaine [ 191 ], nicotine [ 192 ] or amphetamine [ 193 ]. This suggests that the ECS can be strategically targeted in the treatment of drug-abuse and addiction as we will discuss below concerning the role of FAAH.
