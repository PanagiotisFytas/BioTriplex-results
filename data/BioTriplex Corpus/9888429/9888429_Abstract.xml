Title: The role of intestinal immune cells and matrix metalloproteinases in inflammatory bowel disease.
Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become globally intractable. MMPs play a key role in many inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about the role of MMPs in IBD. In this study, IBD expression profiles were screened from public Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that IBD-related specific functions were associated with immune pathways. Five MMPS-related disease markers, namely MMP-9, CD160, PTGDS, SLC26A8, and TLR5, were selected by machine learning and the correlation between each marker and immune cells was evaluated. We then induced colitis in C57 mice using sodium dextran sulfate and validated model construction through HE staining of the mouse colon. WB and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that the expression levels of MMP-9, PTGDS, SLC26A8, and CD160 in colitis were significantly increased, whereas that of TLR5 were decreased. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that MMPs regulate intestinal inflammation and immunity mainly through CD8 in colitis. Our findings reveal that MMPs play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IBD and are related to the infiltration of immune cells, suggesting that MMPs may promote the development of IBD by activating immune infiltration and the immune response. This study provides insights for further studies on the occurrence and development of IBD.
