GSEA and KEGG pathway analysis
RNA-Seq (level-3) data of ESCC ( n  = 81), HNSC (HPV- samples,  n  = 436), and LUSC ( n  = 501) were downloaded from TCGA (released on March 26, 2019; GDC V16.0). Microarray expression data of ESCC (GSE53624 and SRP064894) and LUSC (GSE4573) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database 67 – 69 . We first ranked tumor samples based on the expression of TP63, and classified the samples into two groups (top and bottom 30% samples). Secondly, differentially expressed genes were determined using limma R package 70 . GSEA Preranked method 71  was performed to identify the Hallmark pathways. ClusterProfiler R package was used to perform KEGG pathway analysis 72 .
Motif enrichment analysis
HOMER  findMotifsGenome.pl  function was used to identify enriched motifs in selected regions. The parameters in HOMER is hg19 -size 200 -len 8,10,12 73 .
RNA-seq data analysis
The RNA-seq data of siSREBF1, siTP63, and siKLF5 were generated in TE5 and KYSE150 cell lines. Trim galore was used to remove the adapters. 49 bp single-end and 150 bp paried-end reads were aligned to human reference genome (HG19) using STAR (–alignIntronMin 20–alignIntronMax 1000000 –alignSJoverhangMin 8 –quantMode GeneCounts) method 74 . DESeq2 was used to identify the differentially expressed genes based on the read counts 75 . Data have been deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE143803).

Immunofluorescence
Cells grown on coverslips, were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Then cells were stained with HCS LipidTOX™ Green Neutral Lipid Stain (Thermo Scientific, H34475) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were analyzed using the Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope.
Western blotting
Total cell lysates were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, 161-0737). Protein concentrations were determined with Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the instruction. Western blotting was performed for 20 μg protein using SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Primary antibody was incubated overnight in cold room. Secondary antibody was incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP assay was performed in TE5 and KYSE150 cells. Using 15 ml tubes, we first harvested 1 × 10 7  cells TE5 or KYSE150 cells cultured in 15 cm dish and washed cells with cold PBS twice. Then the cells were fixed in 4 ml of 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, which were quenched with 4 ml of 250 mM glycine for 5 min, followed by two washes with cold PBS. These cells were lysed twice with 1 ml lysis/wash buffer (formula: 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 M EDTA pH 7.5, 1 M Tris pH 7.5, 0.5% NP-40) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed by mechanically pipetting up and down several times in a microcentrifuge tube. We then centrifuged these samples at 12,000 ×  g  for 5 minutes at 4 °C and discarded the supernatant. Cell pellets were next resuspended in 1 ml shearing buffer (formula: 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 50 nM Tris pH 8.0) and were sonicated using a Covaris sonicator. Subsequently, we cleared the samples by centrifugation at 12,000 ×  g  for 10 min at 4 °C and retained the supernatants. The supernatants were then diluted five times using the dilution buffer (formula: 0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 150 nM NaCl). We then added primary antibodies (5 μg SREBF1 or KLF5) and incubated with the samples at 4 °C overnight on a rotating platform. Dynabeads Protein G beads (Thermo Scientific, 10004D) were then added the next morning, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for an additional of 4 h on a rotating platform. These Dynabeads were collected by centrifugation and were washed five times with cold wash buffer and once with cold TE buffer. DNA samples were generated by reverse crosslinking using 5 M NaCl at 65 °C overnight and purification. The final products were subject to DNA library preparation and deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq platform.
ChIP-Seq data analysis
ChIP-Seq data of SREBF1 were generated in both TE5 and KYSE150 cell lines, and ChIP-Seq data of KLF5 was generated in TE5 cell line. ChIP-Seq data of SREBF1 in MCF7 and HepG2 cell lines were from ENCODE consortium. In addition, we reprocessed H3K27Ac ChIP-Seq data in eight ESCC cell lines (TE5, TE7, KYSE70, KYSE150, KYSE140, KYSE180, KYSE200, and KYSE510) from our previous work 30 , 31 , 33 . Briefly, 150 bp paired-end and 50 bp single-end reads were aligned to human reference genome (HG19) using Bowtie2 (v2.2.6) (k = 2) 77 . Then we used Picard MarkDuplicates tool to mark PCR duplicates. ENCODE blacklisted regions were removed ( https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists ). Macs2 was utilized to identify the peaks with the parameters –bdg –SPMR –nomodel –extsize 200 -q 0.01. Bigwig files were generated by bamCompare in DeepTools (v3.1.3) using parameters –binSize 10 –numberOfProcessors 5 –scaleFactorsMethod None –normalizeUsing CPM –ignoreDuplicates –extendReads 200 from Ramirez et al., 2014 78 . In addition, bigwig files of H3K27Ac, H3K4Me3, TP63, and SOX2 ChIP-Seq in TE5 cell line were generated by us previously 30 , 33 . The bigwig files were visualized in Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) 79 . Data have been deposited to GEO database (GSE143803).
Circular chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C-seq) assay
4C-seq experiments 33 , 80 – 82  were performed in TE5 cells. We first collected 40 million TE5 cells and performed crosslinking using 1% formaldehyde for 10 min by rotating. The reaction was quenched by incubation with 2.66 M glycine for 5 min. We then isolated the nuclei pellets using lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Nuclei pellets were next resuspended in 1× CutSmart buffer (NEB) containing 0.3% SDS and incubated at 37 °C with shaking in thermomixer for 1 h. We then added 10% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 2% followed by incubating with shaking at 37 °C for 1 h. Nuclei were next digested by 4000 U HindIII (NEB) at 37 °C, 900RPM overnight. HindIII digestion efficiency was assessed by gel electrophoresis using the extracted DNA from QC samples. Upon the verification of the digestion efficiency of QC samples, HindIII digestion was inactivated by 10% SDS (to a final concentration of 1.6%) and incubated at 65 °C for 25 min. 100 μg digested DNA was quantified by Qubit BR kit and used for ligation with 1% Triton X-100 and 990 U T4 DNA ligase (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) at 16 °C overnight. We then reverse cross-linked the ligation reaction by proteinase K (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) at 65 °C for 4 h and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The “3 C libraries” were generated by ligation products after purification by phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation. This “3 C libraries” were then digested by a 500 µl DpnII reaction overnight at 37 °C using this formula: 50 μg 3 C library, DpnII buffer (NEB) and 50 U DpnII (NEB). This reaction was again followed by phenol-chloroform purification and ethanol precipitation and Qubit BR quantification, which produced the “4C libraries”. 3.2ug 4C libraries for each viewpoint were then amplified by two rounds of PCR reactions. The scaled-up product was loaded into 4–20% TBE gel followed by gel crush, clean-up (by AMpure beads) and Bioanalyzer quantification to generate the final libraries. DNA Sequencing was performed using MiSeq platform with Illumina 150 bp pair-end kit. Two replicates were generated and sequencing results were analyzed by r3Cseq package 83 .
The viewpoint of SREBF1 promoter region was chr17:17738740-17740085 (hg19) with 4C primers: NEST-Forward-GCAACCAGCTGGGCTCAT, OUTER-Forward-GAAGCAACGGGCCTCCTAAT, NEST-Reverse-CTGCTGACCGACATCGAAGG and OUTER-Reverse-TTGCGAGGTTACTCACGGTC. 4C-seq Data have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE178923).
Computational annotation of typical-enhancer and super-enhancer
The method of ROSE (Rank Order of Super Enhancers) 84 , 85  was first used to identify enhancers defined as H3K27Ac peaks 2 Kb away from any transcription start site (TSS). Following stitching enhancer elements clustered within a distance of 12.5 Kb, typical-enhancers and super-enhancers were then classified using a cutoff at the inflection point (tangent slope = 1) based on the ranking order. The scatterplots (Fig.  2b ) contained all typical-enhancers and super-enhancers from each sample.
Luciferase reporter assays
Enhancer and promoter elements were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGL3-based luciferase reporter vectors (Promega, E1761). Primers were provided in Supplementary Table  4 . Constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. Vectors were transfected into TE5 cell line using BioT (Bioland, B01-01). A Renilla luciferase vector was co-transfected as a control for normalization. After 48 h of transfection, the luciferase activity was measured by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, E1960).
Construction of expression vectors
The shRNA expression vector was designed based on siRNA sequences and cloned into pLKO-puro vector by Guangzhou IGE Biotechnol OGY LTD. The ORF of SREBF1 was cloned into pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP-T2A-Puro by Guangzhou IGE Biotechnology Ltd. The sgRNA sequences were cloned into pLV hU6-sgRNA hUbC-dCas9-KRAB-T2a-puro vector, which was from Addgene (plasmid catolog#: 71236). To produce viral particles, the recombinant viral vectors and packaging vectors were co-transfected into 293FT cells. Supernatants were harvested and filtered through a 0.45 µM filter 48 h after transfection. ESCC cells were then infected with the virus in the presence of 10 mg/ml Polybrene. The siRNA, shRNA and sgRNA sequences are provided in Supplementary Table  5 .
Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based lipidomics
LC-MS/MS-based lipidomics 86  was performed in KYSE510 cell lines. We first extracted lipid species from 1 × 10 6  cells by methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (Sigma Aldrich) and concentrated the samples in a SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Scientific). Dried lipid samples were resuspended using a loading buffer (formula: 50% isopropanol, 50% methanol) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS, using an Ultimate 3000 XRS LC system connected to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). We loaded 20 μl of lipid solution onto a 15-cm Accucore Vanquish C 18  column (1.5 μm particle size, 2.1 mm diameter). Lipid molecules were separated using a 28-min LC gradient (35–60% mobile phase B for 4 min, 60–70% B for 16 min, 70–100% B for 1 min, 100% B for 3 min, 100–35% B for 0.1 min, and 35% B for 3.9 min) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Here, the mobile phase A consisted of 60% acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid, while the mobile phase B consisted of 90% isopropanol, 10% acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid. Mass spectra were next acquired by an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos operated in both positive and negative ion modes. Parameter settings for FTMS1 were as follows: orbitrap resolution of 120,000, scan range of  m/z  250–1,200, AGC of 2 × 10 5 , maximum injection time of 50 ms, RF lens of 50%, data type of profile, dynamic exclusion for 8 s with a mass tolerance of 25 ppm, and cycle time of 2 s. Parameters for FTMS2 were as follows: orbitrap resolution of 30,000, isolation window of 1.2  m/z , activation type of HCD, collision energy of 30 ± 3%, maximum injection time of 70 ms, AGC of 5 × 10 4 , and data type of profile.
We analyzed the acquired raw files using the software LipidSearch (v1.4) (Thermo Scientific) for sample peak alignment, MS/MS identification as well as calculation of MS1 peak area. Statistical analyses were performed using the Perseus (v1.6.6.0) software 87 , and the  P  values were determined by two-tailed Student’s  t -test and followed by multiple hypothesis correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.
Immunohistochemistry
A total of 179 formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues were collected from surgical samples of ESCC patients treated at the Shantou Central Hospital (November 2007 to January 2011). All tumor and nonmalignant samples were confirmed by pathologists of the Shantou Central Hospital. This study was approved by the ethical committees of the Shantou Central Hospital as well as the Medical College of Shantou University.
We first constructed tissue microarrays using FFPE specimens described above, which were cut into 4-μm sections. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed by a two-step protocol (PV-9000 Polymer Detection System, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We cleared the paraffin of the FFPE sections three times with xylene for ten minutes each, followed by rehydration using gradient alcohol (100%, 95%, 75%, 50% alcohol). Then we rinsed these glass slides twice by deionized water for five minutes each. The tissue sections were blocked with 5% BSA for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibodies (Anti-SREBF1, Proteintech, 14088-1-AP, 1:300; anti-TP63, Proteintech, 60332-1, 1:500; anti-KLF5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-398409X, 1:500) at 4 °C overnight. The tissue sections were rinsed with PBS, followed by the incubation of Reagent 1 and then Reagent 2 at 37 °C for 20 min each. After three washes by PBS, glass slides were stained with diaminobenzidine and counterstained by hematoxylin. The staining of SREBF1, TP63, and KLF5 was evaluated by IHC scores 88 , 89 . Briefly, the images of IHC on tissue microarrays were obtained using PerkinElmer Vectra on brightfield microscope. The level of nucleus or cytoplasm of SREBF1 protein in individual sample was automatically evaluated and digitally scored based upon the intensity of staining, as well as the proportion of cells with positive staining by the Nuance™ system and InForm™ software (Cambridge Research & Instrumentation). The staining score (ranging from 0 to 300) was used for statistical analysis. The overall survival was defined as the time from the date of primary surgery to the date of death due to esophageal cancer and data on survivors were recorded at the last follow-up.
Colony formation assay
Five hundred cells in 2 ml of complete medium were seeded into six-well plates, which were kept at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO 2  for 1 week. Colonies were fixed with methanol and stained with 0.05% of crystal violet, and counted using ImageJ software.
Trans-well migration assay
Trans-well migration assay was performed in 6.5 mm insert with 8.0 µm polycarbonate membranes in 24-well plates (COSTAR, 3422). 5 × 10 4  cells were seeded on top of the chamber with 100 µl of serum-free medium. The bottom chambers were supplied with regular medium with 10% FBS. After 48 h, top chamber surfaces were wiped by a cotton stick, and cells that migrated to the other side of chamber membrane were fixed by methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet and quantified by counting 10 random fields under a light microscope (×200). Data obtained from three separate chambers were shown as mean values.
Xenograft assays in nude mice
Five-week-old male nude mice were purchased for the xenograft assays from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China) 88 . All animal studies were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Research Committee of the Shantou Administration Center of Shantou University. Ten mice were randomly separated in two groups and subcutaneously injected with 1 × 10 6  cells expressing inducible vectors containing either nontargeting scrambled shRNA or shRNA against SREBF1. The animal housing room was maintained at 22.2 ± 1 °C (72 °F), 30–40% humidity with at least 12 fresh-air changes hourly and a controlled 14:10-h light:dark cycle.
For experiments using Fatostatin 16 , 51 , at day 7 post tumor cell injection, drug administration was initiated. Briefly, a 100 mg/ml Fatostatin stock solution was prepared in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide. On the day of injection, Fatostatin was diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 30 mg/kg in 200 µL solution, which was administered to mice. Fatostatin and its diluent control was intraperitoneally administered daily for 14 days. Xenograft size was measured by (length × width 2  × 0.5) every 4 days for 21 days. Mice were euthanized at the end of experiment, and xenograft tumors were extracted for analysis.
Statistical analysis
The analyses for IHC were performed with SPSS for Windows ver.18.0 software (SPSS Institute, Chicago, IL, USA). Kaplan–Meier curve was constructed for overall survival analysis using a Log-rank test. Each  P -value is two-tailed and significance level is 0.05. For comparisons of continuous variables between groups, two-tailed Student  t -test was used. The values at  P  < 0.05 (*) and  P  < 0.01 (**) were considered statistically significant. Diagrams were created by GraphPad Prism software and data were shown as the mean ± SEM. The exact  P -values were provided in Supplementary Data  5 .
