2.1. Generation of Cell Fusion Hybrid Clones
Within tumor tissue, there are many different cell types, such as fibroblasts, immunocompetent cells and MSCs. To investigate if spontaneous cell fusion of MSCs and breast cancer cells could take place, in vitro studies were done. Therefore, two different human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 Hyg and HS578T Hyg) were separately cocultured with human immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSC#3). Possible hybrid clones were identified by double antibiotic selection and verified by STR-analysis ( Figure S1 ). Four MDA-MB-231 Hyg × iMSC#3 hybrid clones (named MM#X) were analyzed, but only two could be verified as proper hybrid clones. By the fusion of HS578T Hyg × iMSC#3 cells, eleven hybrid clones were generated (named MH#X), but only 10 could be verified. For further studies, two hybrid clones from each fusion combination were selected, MM#2, MM#3, MH#7 and MH#9, because they showed the highest amount of overlapping parental alleles.
2.2. General Characteristics of the Hybrid Clones
Initially, general differences between the hybrid clones and their parental cell lines were examined. In an XTT-proliferation assay, the metabolic activity, which can be correlated to the proliferation of the cells, was tested. Hybrid clones MH#7 and MM#2 showed an increased proliferation rate in comparison to both parental cell lines, while MM#3 cells seemed to grow fast in the first 72 h, but then the proliferation rate decreased as fast as it first increased ( Figure 1 a). The large size of the cells may have had an impact on the proliferation rate; for example, the tight contact of the cells may have led to a growth arrest, or the cells had already reached the stationary phase within the growth curve. MH#9 cells proliferated faster than the iMSC#3, but slower than the HS578T Hyg cells.
Skarn et al. showed that iMSC#3 cells were able to differentiate into osteoblasts [ 23 ]. Hence, the ability to differentiate was tested for MDA-MB-231 Hyg, HS578T Hyg and all four hybrid cells. As shown in  Figure 1 , in addition to iMSC#3 cells, all four hybrid cells were also able to differentiate. Notably, MM#2 seemed to undergo osteogenic differentiation to a greater extent than MH#7 and MH#9. MM, #3 formed some kind of 3D structure, detached from the plate surface, and formed knobs ( Figure 1 b, white arrow). From the parental BC cell lines, HS578T Hyg cells also showed an enhanced ability to differentiate in comparison to MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells. In summary, the results for MDA-MB-231 Hyg and MH#9 cells showed a lighter staining intensity, indicating that they did not express stem cell characteristics in a high manner, as, for instance, MM#2 cells did.
2.3. Hybrid Clones Show Different and Distinct Expression Patterns of Stem Cell Characteristics
To test the clonogenic potential of the hybrid clones, a colony formation assay was performed. Hybrid clones MH#7 and MH#9 showed a significantly increased colony formation capacity in comparison to both parental cell lines. In addition, MM#2 and MM#3 cells were able to form more colonies than iMSC#3 cells ( Figure 2 a,b).
Next, the ability to form mammospheres was tested. In comparison to iMSC#3 cells and HS578T-Hyg breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells formed loose cell aggregates rather than proper mammospheres ( Figure 3 a). The hybrids MM#2 and MM#3 were able to form proper mammospheres, which were larger than the iMSC#3 spheres, but did not form as many. The same applies to the hybrids MH#7 and MH#9. They showed slightly larger spheres than did iMSC#3 cells, but there were not as many. The BC cells HS578T Hyg exhibited the significantly largest and the highest amount of mammospheres of all tested cell lines ( Figure 3 b,c).
In summary, there seem to be correlations between the results of three in four experiments, but the constitutions differ between the single cell lines. For example, the XTT-assay, mammosphere diameter and osteogenic differentiation results demonstrate that MM#2 cells expressed these characteristics at a higher level, whereas MH#9 cells expressed them on a low level. In contrast, the CFA data show exactly the opposite result. These data indicate that hybrid cells express stem cell characteristics very individually.
By the use of the AldeRed Assay, the number of expressed ALDH1 positive cells was investigated. ALDH1 has been suggested to be a marker for adult stem cells, but also for cancer stem/initiating cells [ 25 ]. As expected, iMSC#3 cells produced the highest number of ALDH1-positive cells, approximately 6%. In contrast, virtually no ALDH1-positive MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells were detected, which is in agreement with other studies [ 22 , 26 ]. Interestingly, both MM#2 and MM#3 cells exhibited an increased number of ALDH1-positive cells in comparison to the MDA-MB-231 Hyg parental cell line. Analysis of MH#7 and MH#9 hybrid clones revealed that the number of ALDH1-positive cells, approximately 2%, was comparable to HS578T Hyg cells ( Figure 4 a).
An additional aid for identifying breast cancer stem cells is the expression of CD44 + /CD24 −/low  cells. The three parental cell lines and the four hybrid clones were analyzed using flow cytometry. In brief, all seven cell lines exhibited more than 90% of CD44 + /CD24 −/low  cells ( Figure 4 b).
2.4. EMT-Marker
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers include SLUG, SNAIL and SOX9, as well as CD44/CD104. The expression of CD44 + /CD104 +  is typical for cells undergoing EMT [ 27 ]. The presence of these markers was examined using FACS analysis. For all cell lines except MDA-MB-231 Hyg, over 80% of all cells exhibited a CD44 + /CD104 −  expression pattern, which is characteristic of mesenchymal cells ( Figure 5 a). Approximately 60% of MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells were CD44 + /CD104 −  and 40% were CD44 + /CD104 + . For hybrid clones MH#7 and MH#9, approximately 15–20% of all cells were CD44 + /CD104 + .
In addition to CD44/CD104, additional markers were examined in Western blot studies. The parental BC cell lines MDA-MB-231 Hyg and HS578T Hyg showed a similar expression profile. Both expressed SLUG, SNAIL, vimentin and ZEB2, but lacked E-cadherin, N-cadherin and ZEB1. While MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells lacked Twist, HS578T Hyg cells lacked SOX9 expression. iMSC#3 cells expressed all of the investigated markers except E-cadherin, but mostly in small amounts. The hybrid clone MM#2 showed a similar expression profile as iMSC#3 cells. MM#3 expressed a larger amount of SNAIL, SLUG, SOX9, vimentin and Twist in comparison to both parental cell lines. Therefore, no E-cadherin, N-cadherin and ZEB1 were detectable. MH#7 and MH#9 also expressed more SNAIL, SOX9 and vimentin compared to both parental cell lines. Both MH-hybrid clones were negative for E-cadherin, N-cadherin and ZEB1 ( Figure 5 b).
2.5. Analysis of Signaling Kinetics
Likewise, the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), HER3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was also analyzed. While the expression of EGFR and HER2 was detectable for all cell lines, only MM#2 expressed HER3 ( Figure 6 a).
To analyze which signaling pathway may be active in the hybrid cells, cells were stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 1, 2 or 5 min. Afterward, Western blot analysis was used to investigate if phosphorylated Akt and/or Erk1/2 is expressed ( Figure 6 b). Nonphosphorylated Akt was detectable in all cell lines except in iMSC#3 cells upon stimulation with EGF. Non-phosphorylated Erk1/2 was expressed by all cell lines, but in iMSC#3 and MH#9 cells, the amount seemed to be lower in stimulated cells compared to unstimulated cells. In iMSC#3, MDA-MB-231 Hyg, MM#2 and MM#3 cells, no phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) was detectable, while in HS578T Hyg, MH#7 and MH#9 cells, the amount of pAkt increased in accordance with EGF exposure time. Likewise, increasing amounts of phosphorylated Erk1/2 (pErk1/2) were seen in iMSC#3, HS578T Hyg and MH#7 cells, while the amount of pErk1/2 in the other cells was constant or even decreasing in accordance with the time of EGF treatment time. These results match the previous results regarding the mixed capacities hybrid cells gained from their parental cells.
2.6. Cytotoxicity Tests
To test whether the hybrid clones react differently to cytostatic drugs, XTT analysis was performed using either paclitaxel or doxorubicin at concentrations of 0.1 µM/1 µM/10 µM. In brief, all cell lines died quickly after treatment with paclitaxel. Similar findings were observed after treatment with doxorubicin for iMSC#3, HS578T Hyg, and MM#2 cells. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 Hyg, MM#3, MH#7 and MH#9 cells exhibited resistance against doxorubicin at a concentration of 0.1 µM ( Figure 7 a,b).
