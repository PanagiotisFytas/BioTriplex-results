Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, and the second most frequent overall [ 1 ]. This disease can be caused by a variety of factors concerning lifestyle, the art of living, habitation, family background and genetic variations, to name a few [ 1 ]. The complexity of BC is one reason why treatment is particularly difficult and needs multidisciplinary investigations [ 2 ]. The very fact that BC can be separated into different subtypes relating to the histology, the genetic hormone receptor status and the invasiveness underlines this aspect. Tumor heterogeneity is a huge problem, as are metastasis and recurrences. Unfortunately, there still is little known about how and why these phenomena occur.
In this context, so-called cancer stem/initiating cells (CS/ICs) came to the forefront of research. CS/ICs are thought to be the reason for cancer recurrences, but also for tumor invasion and resistance against chemotherapy and radiation treatment [ 3 ]. They are mainly distinguished by their ability to self-renew as well as to differentiate. Many hypotheses have been made about the origin of CS/ICs. It was demonstrated that different factors might be responsible for the formation of CS/ICs, including differentiation of adult stem cells into CS/ICs [ 4 ] and differentiation of non-CS/ICs into CS/ICs by mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer, metabolic shifts and cell fusion [ 3 ]. Because of these different possible origins, CS/ICs show phenotypic plasticity leading to a heterogeneous cell population, making it difficult to define CS/IC characteristics [ 5 ]. There are also processes such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) promoting this state [ 6 ]. In this study, we wanted to focus on cell fusion and to determine if cell fusion hybrid cells gain CSC characteristics.
Cell fusion is a rare but very important process found in physiological processes, including tissue regeneration [ 7 ], fertilization [ 8 ], and muscle development or osteogenesis [ 9 ], as well as in pathophysiological contexts such as viral infection [ 10 ]. It was demonstrated by different working groups that fused cells could be found within a solid tumor [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] and in the circulating blood [ 14 , 15 , 16 ]. These newly gained hybrid cells exhibited different characteristics than the parental cells. Xu et al. showed that hybrid cells derived from the fusion of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and three different lung cancer cell lines (A549, H460 and SK-MES-1) exhibited an increased tumorigenic potential when the cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Fused cells gave rise to larger tumors and additionally produced tumors more efficiently than the respective parental lung cancer cells [ 17 ]. In a different study, Mi et al. demonstrated that the metastatic potential of tumor × tumor hybrid cells was increased compared to unfused, parental tumor cells [ 18 ]. Likewise, altered resistance to radiation and chemotherapy was also seen in hybrid cells [ 19 , 20 ]. The fusion of cancer cells with cell lines exhibiting a mesenchymal phenotype, such as leukocytes or mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, may lead to a gain of function within cancer cells, afterward exhibiting the ability to migrate.
In previous studies, we demonstrated that hybrid cells, generated by spontaneous cell fusion of human breast epithelial M13SV1-EGFP-Neo cells and different breast cancer cell lines (HS578T Hyg; MDA-MB-231 Hyg; MDA-MB-435 Hyg), exhibited individual stem cell and/or tumorigenic characteristics. M13MDA435 hybrids, for example, showed increased migratory activity and different resistance capabilities compared to the parental cell lines [ 7 ]. A variety of stem cell properties, such as the formation of mammospheres or the number of ALDH1-positive cells, had been demonstrated for M13HS hybrid cells [ 21 ]. In addition to these results, we concluded that hybrid properties were extremely dependent on parental cell characteristics [ 22 ]. To amplify this hypothesis, we generated hybrid cells by spontaneous fusion of immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSC#3) and either MDA-MB-231 Hyg or HS578T Hyg breast cancer cells. iMSC#3 cells are telomerase-immortalized, nontumorigenic and can be cultured for a long time [ 23 ]. It was previously reported that MSCs could be found in primary breast cancer tissues and that these cells impact the proliferation and mammosphere formation of MCF7 cells [ 24 ]. Here, we investigated different stem cell (SC)/CS/IC characteristics such as the number of ALDH1-positive cells, the formation of colonies and mammospheres, and different markers using flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. In short, we could confirm that hybrid cells exhibit an individual phenotype and that this phenotype is dependent on parental cell line characteristics.
