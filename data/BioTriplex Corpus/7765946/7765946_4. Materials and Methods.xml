4.2. Spontaneous Cell Fusion
To generate cell fusion hybrids, either iMSC#3 (1 × 10 6 ) and HS578T Hyg (1 × 10 6 ) or iMSC#3 (1 × 10 6 ) and MDA-MB-231 Hyg (1 × 10 6 ) cells were co-cultivated in media specific for the appropriate breast cancer cell line at 5% CO 2  and 37 °C. After 24 h, media were replaced by media containing antibiotics (100 µg/mL hygromycin B (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany); 1 µg/mL puromycin (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France)). Hybrid cells exhibiting double resistance were isolated and individually cultivated. Overall, 11 iMSC#3 × HS578T Hyg hybrids, named MH#X, and 2 iMSC#3 × MDA-MB-231 Hyg hybrids, namely, MM#X, were isolated (X = clone number).
4.3. STR-Analysis
Short tandem repeat analysis was performed by the working group of W. Gerding (Ruhr-University Bochum, Department of Human Genetics) using the Powerplex ®  16HS System DC2101 (Promega). Therefore, 100 ng genomic DNA was prepared using the NucleoSpin ®  tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH and Co. KG, Düren, Germany) per the manufacturer’s instructions (concentration was photometrically determined) and sent to their laboratory. Examination of the degree of the relationship was performed using Excel.
4.4. Osteogenic Differentiation
For osteogenic differentiation, 1 × 10 5  cells/well were seeded into a 6-well plate and incubated at 5% CO 2  and 37 °C for 1 day. On the next day, media were exchanged. Control cells received the cell-line-specific medium, while the tested cells got osteogenic differentiation medium consisting of DMEM (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS (FCS; Biochrom GmbH, Berlin, Germany), 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), 100 nM dexamethasone 21-phosphate disodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate (Merck, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and 50 µM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). The medium was replaced two times per week, and cells were cultured for 21 days at 5% CO 2  and 37 °C. Afterward, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and stained with Alizarin Red S (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) for 30 min at RT and washed 3 times with aqua destillata (A. dest.).
4.5. XTT Proliferation and Cytostatic Assay
On the first day, 2500 cells/well were seeded on a 96-well plate and cultured in a cell-type-specific medium. For proliferation studies, the medium was removed after 24 h and replaced by RPMI 1640 without phenol red (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). Then, 50 µg/well XTT and 0.25 µg/well PMS (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) were added, and plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After 3 h, the reaction was measured with an ELISA reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). This procedure was repeated after 48 h, 72 h and 96 h. For cytostatic studies, the medium was also removed after 24 h, and it was replaced by a medium containing either 0.1 µmol, 1 µmol or 10 µmol doxorubicin or paclitaxel (both: Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Afterward, cells were again incubated for 24 h before media were exchanged by RPMI 1640 without phenol red (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). Then, 50 µg/well XTT and 0.25 µg/well PMS were added, and plates were incubated 3 h at 37 °C. After 3 h, the reaction was measured with an ELISA (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) reader. This procedure was repeated after 48 h and 72 h.
Colony formation assay:
In a 6-well plate, 200 cells/well were seeded and cultured for 10 days, changing the cell-line-specific media after 2–3 days. After 10 days, the media were removed, and the cells were washed with PBS (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). For fixation, 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used; for coloring of the cells, 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) was used. Crystal violet was incubated for 30 min at RT and afterward washed away with H 2 O. The plate was air-dried at RT. Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ (imagej.-nih.gov/ij/).
4.6. Mammosphere Assay
For mammosphere assays, 96-well plates were coated with 1.2% poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) in ethanol and dried for 10 days at 37 °C. Five hundred cells/well were seeded and cultured in mammosphere formation medium at 37 °C for 7 days. Mammosphere formation medium consisted of two different media (medium I and II) in a ratio of 1:4. Medium I was composed of DMEM/F12 (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) + B27 supplement (Gibco, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) + 20 ng/mL FGF (human recombinant; Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) + 20 ng/mL EGF (human recombinant; Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) + 0.39 µg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). Medium II is composed of Methocult H4100 (Stem Cells Technologies, Köln, Germany) + DMEM (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) (ratio 2:3). After 7 days, images were generated with a microscope and analyzed using ImageJ 1.8.0 ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html ).
4.7. AldeRed Assay
The expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) was examined by using the AldeRed ALDH detection assay (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s manual. First, 2 × 10 5  cells were harvested and resuspended in AldeRed assay buffer containing the efflux inhibitor Verapamil and AldeRed 588A substrate. One half of the cell suspension was transferred to a new reaction tube and provided with diethylamino-benzaldehyde (DEAB), which is a specific ALDH1 inhibitor; this sample served as a control. Afterward, cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the dark and centrifuged (300×  g , 5 min). The cell pellet was washed in 500 µL of AldeRed assay buffer. Samples were analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickenson, Heidelberg, Germany), and FACS data were evaluated using WinMDI 2.9.
4.8. Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry was used to analyze CSC and EMT markers in hybrid and parental cells. In this experiment, 1.5 × 10 5  cells were stained with different antibodies in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and measured with a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson, Heidelberg, Germany). Isotype-matched antibodies served as controls. All antibodies are listed in  Table 1 .
4.9. Western Blot
For the generation of Western blot samples, 2 × 10 5  cells were treated with 3× Lemmli sample buffer (ratio 1:2) and lysed for 10 min at 95 °C. EGF-stimulated samples were treated with 100 ng/mL EGF (human recombinant; Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) for 1, 2 or 5 min before 3× Lemmli sample buffer was added and cells were lysed for 10 min at 95 °C. For 8%, 10% or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), the samples were separated and afterward transferred to an Immobilon polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) nitrocellulose membrane (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) under semidry conditions. The membranes were then blocked with 5% ( w / v ) nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for at least 1 h. All antibodies were used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Visualization of protein bands was executed by using the Pierce ECL Western blot substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bonn, Germany) and the Aequoria macroscopic imaging system (Hamamatsu Photonics Germany, Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany). All images were evaluated using ImageJ (imagej.-nih.gov/ij/).
4.10. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7. In the case of a rectangular distribution of the data, a one-way ANOVA test with the following post hoc test was used. If not, a Kruskal-Wallis test and appropriate post hoc test were performed. Unless otherwise mentioned, data were generated in at least three independent experiments.
