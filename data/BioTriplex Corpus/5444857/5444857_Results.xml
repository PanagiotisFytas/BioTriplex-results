Lp25 is associated with rhabdomyolysis and oliguric acute kidney injury
A total of 37 guinea pigs were assigned into one of three treatment groups: control (n = 10), LipL32 (n = 13) or Lp25 (n = 14). Initial body weights were similar between the 3 groups: 194±4 g (control), 195±4 g (LipL32) and 191±3 g (Lp25). Weight gain was lower in the LipL32 group (18±3 g, p<0,05) and Lp25 group (13±3 g, p<0,01) than the control group (28±2 g) on day 5.  Fig 1  shows that the GFR, evaluated as creatinine clearance (CrCl), was significantly lower in the Lp25 group (0.47±0.03 mL/min/100 gBW) than the control group (1.05±0.13 mL/min/100 gBW) and LipL32 (0.87±0.10 mL/min/100 gBW). The urinary volume was lower in the Lp25 group (12.0±1.3 UV mL/12h) than the control group (23.0±3.8 UV mL/12h) and the LipL32 group (17.3±3.6 UV mL/12h). Notably, the serum potassium level in the Lp25 group (6.7±0.5 mEq/L) was elevated, compared to the control group (4.7±0.2 mEq/L) and the LipL32 group (5.7±0.3 mEq/L). The fractional excretion of sodium was similar in the three groups (control 0.82±0.18%; LipL32 0.60±0.09%; Lp25 0.83± 0.15%).
The Lp25 group had significantly higher levels of serum CPK, phosphate and uric acid (2060±338 CPK U/L; 8.36±0.32 P mg/dL and 2.75±0.56 acid uric mg/dL) ( Fig 2 ). These parameters in the LipL32 group (726±216 CPK U/L; 6.70±0.41 P mg/dL and 1.06±0.28 acid uric mg/dL) were similar to the control group (763±197 CPK U/L; 7.06±0.30 P mg/dL and 1.07±0.20 acid uric mg/dL).
AKI was observed in all animals of Lp25 group (100%) and 7/14 (50%) of these also had oliguria. In the LipL32 group, 2/13 animals (15.38%) had AKI oliguric and 1/13 (7.69%) presented AKI nonoliguric. Hyperkalemia was seen in 13/14 (92.85%) guinea pigs in the Lp25 group vs 8/13 (61.53%) in the LpL32 group.
In the Lp25 group, rhabdomyolysis, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia were encountered in 12/14 (85.71%), 10/14 (71.42%) and 9/14 (64.28%) animals, respectively. Seven animals of this group (50%) showed the three outcomes concomitantly. In the LipL32 group, 2/13 (15.38%) had rhabdomyolysis, 3/13 (23.07%) had hyperphosphatemia and 2/13 (15.38%) had hyperuricemia.
Lp25 induced muscular lesions that were more accentuated than LipL32
We performed immunohistological and morphological analyses to assess the effect of the LipL32 and Lp25 proteins on muscle tissues. The anti-rabbit Lp25 antibodies labeled isolated or small groups of muscular fibers with granular, faintly brownish antigen deposits that may partially delineate the sarcolemma and spread to the cytoplasm below ( Fig 3A ). The inflammatory infiltrate was generally discrete and primarily composed of small groups of monocytes that were present as focal isolated interstitial groups or small groups of isolated muscular fibers, frequently with antigenic linear deposits that partially circumscribed muscular fibers or inside their cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic antigenic granules were also detected occasionally in mononuclear phagocytic cells when the inflammatory infiltrate is more conspicuous. Immunohistochemistry with the anti-rabbit LipL32 antibodies was also positive on the sarcolemma and in the cytoplasm of isolated muscular fibers. Scarce mononuclear inflammatory interstitial reactions near the damaged muscle were also present ( Fig 3B ). Histological analyses of the muscle fragments revealed essentially similar muscular lesions were present in animals inoculated with both proteins, but with different degrees of severity ( Fig 3C–3H ). No wide range of muscular fiber sizes (small or large groups of atrophic or hypertrophic fibers) were observed in either protein group. Internal sarcolemmal nuclei were not detected in isolated muscle fibers. However, isolated nonspecific muscular lesions were present and ranged from hyaline contraction cytoplasmatic changes ( Fig 3E and 3F ) to small vacuoles, which may progress to hypercontracted isolated fibers to necrosis prior to phagocytosis ( Fig 3G ) or to intermediate damage, which was characterized by staining changes in myofibrils ( Fig 3F ), including the appearance of pale necrotic cells in H&E and Gomori trichrome stains (“ghost cells “) ( Fig 3F and 3H ). Irregular areas of muscle necrosis were the end result of these muscular disturbances ( Fig 3C and 3D ). Mild inflammatory infiltrate composed of macrophages were also observed around necrotic areas. Fragments from the LipL32 group revealed essentially similar findings to the Lp25 group, but with less frequent focal muscular damage and areas of necrosis ( Fig 3D ).
Muscular lesions severity scores were significantly lower (p<0.05) in the LipL32 group (0.66 ± 0.21) than the Lp25 group (1.43 ± 0.20), and no muscular lesions were observed in the control group. The difference between LipL32 and Lp25-inoculated animals was statistically significant (p<0.05, LipL32 vs. Lp25) ( Fig 4 ). Specifically, 53.85% of animals treated with LipL32 shown no muscular lesions, whereas the lesions of severity stage 1 and 2 were observed in 30.77% and 15.38%, respectively, of guinea pigs inoculated with this protein. Otherwise, all Lp25-inoculated animals presented muscular lesions, of these 42.86% had mild manifestations (stage 1) and 57.14% had severe signs (stage 2). Histological examination of the kidneys revealed no lesions ( S1 Fig ).
Lp25 protein is conserved in pathogenic strains of  Leptospira  spp.
Immunoblots of whole cell lysates revealed that the Lp25 protein was expressed by all strains of pathogenic leptospires tested, and it was not detected in the non-pathogenic strain ( Fig 5A ). Equal results were obtained in immunoblot assays using LipL32 antiserum as a positive control and demonstrated that the Lp25 protein, like the LipL32 [ 25 ], was conserved and only found in pathogenic species of  Leptospira .
Lp25 is an outer membrane protein
All control proteins were detected in whole cell extracts. LigA was completely solubilized by the detergent and fractionated into the aqueous and detergent phases. LipL31 was detected in the insoluble pellet fraction and aqueous phase, and it was completely absent from the detergent phase ( Fig 5B ). We performed an additional experiment using the LipL32 antiserum because a previous work reported that LipL32 was solubilized by Triton X-114 and mostly detected in the detergent fraction [ 25 ].  Fig 5B  shows that the presence of LipL32 in the Triton X-114 fraction was confirmed [ 25 ]. These results demonstrated the correct functioning of the Triton X-114 fractionation method.
We also investigated the surface localization of Lp25 using proteolysis of intact cells of the  L .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain L1-130 using proteinase K.  Fig 5C  shows that Lp25 was susceptible to protease treatment in a dose-dependent manner, and the subsurface LipL32 was not susceptible, which suggests that Lp25 is exposed on the surface. These results are consistent with a previously published study that demonstrated that LipL32 was not exposed on the leptospiral surface, despite its localization in the outer membrane [ 13 ].
