The renal manifestations of leptospirosis are variable and range from mild symptoms, such as low urinary protein excretion and sediment changes, to fatal AKI [ 4 , 27 , 28 ]. Severe cases of AKI are generally oliguric and hyperkalemic with a prolonged course and high mortality rate. Nonoliguric and normo- or hypokalemic AKI-forms are associated with a better prognosis [ 4 ,  27 – 29 ]. The renal pathophysiology that is consequent to leptospirosis infection is not clearly known despite advances in the knowledge of AKI epidemiology [ 4 , 5 ,  28 – 32 ]. Different factors may be involved, such as inflammatory processes, rhabdomyolysis, hemodynamic alterations, immune responses, and direct effects of leptospires and their products [ 30 ,  33 ,  31 ].
This study evaluated the effect of the LipL32 and Lp25 proteins on renal function in normal guinea pigs. We found that only Lp25 was associated with the development of oliguric AKI and rhabdomyolysis-induced hyperkalemia (elevated CPK, uric acid and serum phosphate).
Lp25 decreased the GFR compared LipL32 and control experiments ( Fig 1 ). These results demonstrate, for the first time, that a specific protein from pathogenic  Leptospira  spp. plays an important role in the establishment of the AKI that is observed in Weil’s syndrome. In contrast, LipL32 protein did not produce a decrease in the GFR, despite a report that LipL32 induced interstitial nephritis-mediated gene expression in cultured mouse proximal tubule cells [ 34 ] and acute tubular injury in proximal pronephric ducts from zebrafish larvae kidneys [ 35 ]. These experiments were performed using  in vitro  preparations and another animal species. The decrease in GFR may not be directly dependent on the tubular damage because the FE Na  was not different between the three groups. Previous clinical studies also demonstrated that rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal injuries did not modify sodium excretion [ 36 – 38 ].
Our results from cellular localization assays agree with previous studies that demonstrated that LipL32 was a subsurface protein that was not accessible on the leptospiral surface [ 13 ]. Notably, the role of LipL32 in Leptospira biology is not defined despite its abundant expression [ 14 ] in all pathogenic serovars. Murray and colleagues (2009) demonstrated that LipL32 was not required in acute (hamster) or chronic (rat) infection models for leptospirosis [ 39 ].
The results in Figs  1  and  2 , such as the increase in potassium, creatine phosphokinase, uric acid and phosphate serum levels, are characteristics of the presence of rhabdomyolysis. The classification of the muscular lesions observed in histological preparations using a score ( Fig 4 ) revealed that Lp25 induced the same type of muscular lesions as LipL32, but the Lp25 lesions were much more severe.  Fig 3  shows areas of necrosis and moderate inflammatory infiltrate in the Lp25 group, and the LipL32 group exhibited small areas of necrosis and few inflammatory areas. Immunohistochemistry with anti-rabbit Lp25 and LipL32 antisera were positive for the two proteins and both proteins exhibited the same histological patterns. The deposition of the antigens was more intense in the Lp25 group. These results suggested that the LipL32 and Lp25 proteins reached the muscle tissue and induced lesions. However, lesions in the Lp25 group were more diffuse and apparently more accentuated than the LipL32 group.
We also demonstrated that Lp25 was a surface-exposed and conserved protein in pathogenic species of  Leptospira . Previously published immunoblot studies using sera from leptospirosis patients and infected hamsters showed that Lp25 protein was expressed during the course of leptospiral infection [ 40 , 21 ]. This protein was recently included in the  Leptospira  endostatin-like (Len) family by the automatic NCBI prokaryotic genome re-annotation pipeline [ 41 ]. The members of the Len family bind plasminogen, laminin and human complement regulator factors [ 42 – 44 ,  18 ]. However, we previously demonstrated that Lp25 did not exhibit extracellular matrix-binding properties or play a role in immune evasion via interacting with the human complement regulator C4BP [ 17 , 45 ]. Comparative proteomic analyses of leptospira outer membrane proteins also demonstrated that the Lp25 protein, encoded by the LA0009 gene in  L .  interrogans  serovar Lai, was up-regulated (1.3-fold) after an overnight upshift to 37°C [ 46 ]. These features are also compatible with one of the potential roles of the Lp25 protein, which is causing muscular damage that consequently is associated with oliguric AKI and hyperkalemia. These data demonstrated, for the first time, that Lp25 is associated with rhabdomyolysis, which is an important sign in leptospirosis and may underlie the muscular pain, which is a pathognomonic symptom of this disease.
