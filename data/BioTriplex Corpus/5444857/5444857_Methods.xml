  strains and culture
  serovar Patoc strain Patoc I,  Leptospira noguchii  serovar Panama strain CZ214K,  Leptospira borgpetersenii  serovar Javanica strain Veldrat Batavia 46,  Leptospira borgpetersenii  serovar Tarassovi strain 17,  Leptospira kirschneri  serovar Cynopteri strain 3522C,  Leptospira interrogans  serovar Hardjo strain Hardjoprajitno,  Leptospira interrogans  serovar Pomona strain 13A, and  Leptospira interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 were obtained from the Laboratory of Bacterial Zoonosis, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of São Paulo, Brazil. Leptospira strains were cultured at 29°C under aerobic conditions in liquid EMJH medium (Difco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Boston, MA, USA.) with 10% rabbit serum, enriched with L-asparagine (0.015%), sodium pyruvate (0.001% [wt/vol]), calcium chloride (0.001% [wt/vol]), magnesium chloride (0.001% [wt/vol]), peptone (0.03% [wt/vol]), and meat extract (0.02% [wt/vol]) [ 17 ].
Selection of proteins
LipL32 and Lp25 proteins were chosen for this study because no research has been performed to investigate their effects on renal function experimentally in animals. Lp25 was identified by bioinformatics analyses using the  L .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 genome sequence previously described in studies published by our group [ 17 ]. The selection was based on the prediction of protein localization in the outer membrane. We gave priority to Lp25 because its function is not known. Leptospiral immunoglobulin-like protein A (LigA) [ 19 ] and LpL31 [ 20 ] were used as controls in the immunoblot analysis. LigA is a known outer membrane protein, and LipL31 is an inner membrane-associated protein [ 19 ,  20 ].
Purification of recombinant proteins
Open reading frames LIC10009 (encoding a protein designated Lp25, for leptospiral protein 25, based on its molecular mass) [ 21 ] and LIC11352 (LipL32) were cloned into pAE [ 17 , 22 ] and pDEST-17 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA -or- Paisley, Scotland, UK.) vectors, respectively, as previously described [ 23 ]. The coding sequence of the carboxy-terminal portion of LigA (LigAC), corresponding to nucleotides 1891–3675 (LIC10465), was cloned into a pAE vector as previously described [ 21 ]. The coding sequence of the LipL31 (LIC11456) was amplified using PCR from genomic DNA of  L .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 using the following primers: F: CTCGAGGGAGATAATTCCG and R: CTGCAGTTACTGCCCAGTAG. Sequences were digested using  Xho I and  Hind III restriction enzymes, and fragments were cloned into the pAE vector [ 22 ]. Competent cells of the  E . coli  BL21(DE3) strain were transformed with pAE-Lp25, pAE-LigAC, pDEST-LipL32, and pAE-LipL31 constructs and cultivated until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. The expression of recombinant proteins was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37°C for 3 h. The His-tagged Lp25, LipL32, LigAC, and LipL31 proteins were purified using metal affinity chromatography, as previously described [ 21 ].
Production of polyclonal antisera against recombinant proteins
A New Zealand White rabbit was immunized for each protein via subcutaneous injection of 2 mg of purified recombinant protein absorbed in aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. The rabbits were immunized more two times with the same antigen preparation with fifteen day of interval. The rabbits were bled two weeks after last immunization. The IgG fraction from sera was precipitated using caprylic acid, as previously described [ 24 ].
Isolation of leptospiral outer membrane proteins (OMPs)
OMPs from  L .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 were extracted with Triton X-114 according to a previously described method [ 25 ]. Three distinct fractions were recovered: (P) the detergent-insoluble pellet that corresponds to inner membranes, cytoplasmic components, and non-lysed cells; (A) the aqueous phase that contains periplasmic content, and, (D) the Triton X-114 detergent phase with outer membranes. The whole cell lysate (W) and the obtained fractions were analyzed using immunoblots with LipL32, Lp25, LigA, and LipL31 antisera.
Proteinase K accessibility assay
 .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 (5×10 8  cells/ml) were harvested via centrifugation at 2000 ×  g  for 7 min, gently washed with PBS containing 5 mM MgCl 2 , and collected via centrifugation at 2000 ×  g  for 10 min. Washed spirochetes were gently resuspended in PBS-5mM MgCl 2 , and the evaluation of surface protein localization on intact leptospires was performed by treatment of proteinase K (PK—Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as previously described [ 13 ]. Immunoblot analyses were performed using antibodies against LipL32 and Lp25.
Immunoblotting
Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with LipL32, Lp25, LigA, or LipL31 rabbit polyclonal antisera (diluted 1:500). The membrane was incubated with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody at a 1:5,000 dilution. The positive signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Boston, MA, USA).
Renal function
The guinea pigs were housed one per metabolic cages with food and drinking water freely available. The animals were acclimated to the housing conditions for 1 day prior to experimental procedures. Three groups of animals were studied: (1) control, n = 10 (1 ml of PBS); (2) LipL32, n = 13 (1 ml of PBS plus 400 μg of LipL32) and (3) Lp25, n = 14 (1 ml of PBS plus 400 μg of Lp25). The amount of protein used per dose (400 μg) was the greatest amount maintained in solution without precipitation. The solutions were injected intraperitoneally for 4 days. The animals were placed in metabolic cages for 12 h for urine collection on day 5. The volume of each 12-h urine sample was measured gravimetrically (UV ml/12 h). Urine samples were centrifuged in aliquots to remove suspended material, and urinary creatinine and sodium in the supernatants were measured. After urine collection all animals were anesthetized with a dose of sodium pentobarbital, and whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture. The animals were then killed with an overdose of anesthesia. Serum potassium and sodium were measured using flame photometry. The enzymatic colorimetric method (Labtest, Lagoa Santa, Brazil) was used to measure urinary and serum levels of creatinine, CPK and uric acid. The molybdate method was used to measure serum phosphate. The creatinine clearance (CrCl) was used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by formula: CrCl = U cr  (mg/dL) x UV (ml/min) / P cr  (mg/dL), corrected by 100 g of body weight (ml/min/100 g body weight) [ 26 ]. Fractional excretion of sodium was calculated using the formula: FE Na  = U Na  x P Cr  / P Na  x U Cr  x 100%. AKI was defined as a decrease in the GFR of more than 50% from the mean value obtained in the control group (PBS), and oliguria was defined as a urinary output of less than 50% of mean value of control group (PBS). Rhabdomyolysis was defined as an elevation in serum CPK of at least 3 times the mean value obtained in the control group. The occurrence of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia was defined as an increase of phosphate, potassium, and acid uric levels of more than the mean value of control group (PBS).
Immunohistochemistry and histology analyses
Muscle fragments from legs and paravertebral regions were collected at the time of euthanasia, routinely fixed in 10% buffered formalin (pH 7.2), embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 3 μm. Fragments from kidney were also collected and submitted to routine histological procedures. Sections were analyzed using EnVision (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)-based immunohistochemistry methods, as previously described (5). The antigen retrieval step was performed by pressure cooking in 10 mM sodium citrate pH 6. Following the overnight incubation with primary rabbit polyclonal antisera (diluted 1:3,000–1:4,000) at 4°C and with secondary antibody (Envision peroxidase Dako K4002) for 30 min at room temperature. The presence of nonspecific staining was assessed using preimmune sera. Tissue sections for morphological analyses were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Gomori trichrome stain in selected sections. Muscular lesions were graded on a scale from 0 to 2: 0 as normal (without lesions), 1 as mild (chiefly the presence of individual hyaline contraction change and focal inflammatory interstitial reactivity), and 2 as severe (presence of necrosis, multiple lesions of individual myocytes and interstitial inflammatory infiltrated). Kidney sections were also fixed in 10% buffered formalin and stained with H&E for morphological analyses. Images were captured on an Axiophot Zeiss Axio microscope and analyzed using AxionVision 4.6 software.
Ethics statement
The Ethic Committee on Animal Use of the Butantan Institute (CEUAIB), São Paulo, Brazil, previously approved the experimental protocols under the license numbers 55708 for the rabbit procedure and 99112 for guinea pig procedure. All animal procedures were conducted following the rules issued by the Brazilian National Council for Control of Animal Experimentation (CONCEA).
Statistical analysis
All quantitative data are expressed as the means ± SEM. Differences between the means of multiple parameters were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test. Histological scores were compared using Student’s t-test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA).
