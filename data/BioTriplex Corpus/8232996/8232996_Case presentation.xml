A 36-year-old Cantonese-speaking female presented to our institute with a history of intermittent palpitations and dizziness for two days. Her ECG showed prolonged QTc (481 ms) with symmetric T wave inversions in the right precordial leads (V1-V3) (Figure  1 ). Troponin level was positive at 0.054 ng/mL. She had a similar episode of sudden-onset spontaneous palpitations, which were presumed to be associated with fear and anxiety a month earlier. At that time, she was evaluated in the psychiatry emergency room for generalized anxiety disorder and discharged. There was no known family history of sudden cardiac deaths or strokes. She started to self-monitor using her apple smartwatch (Series 3). However, she could not find anything abnormal whenever she felt palpitations. She then started to use a pulse oximeter at home to monitor her symptoms. Her pulse oximeter showed a heart rate (HR) of more than 200 beats/min during an episode of palpitations and uneasiness in her chest. She went to the hospital with a video showing an HR of more than 200 beats/min (Video  1 ).
Telemetry monitoring showed no abnormalities. Her transthoracic echocardiogram showed dilated and reduced systolic function of the right ventricle (RV) with an apical echogenic tissue and abnormal RV free wall motion. We scheduled her for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and discharged her with an ambulatory 30-day event monitor. Two days after her discharge, she presented again to the emergency room with shortness of breath and palpitations that started while bending to lift a heavy object. She denied excess caffeine intake, syncope, chest pain, or recreational drug usage. Her ECG showed wide complex VT with a rate of more than 200 beats/min (Figure  2 ). Labs were notable for positive troponin 0.016 ng/mL, pro B-type natriuretic peptide 143 pg/mL, lactate of 2.8 mmol/L, Mg 1.7 mEq/L, and Hg 11.2 g/dL (mean corpuscular volume 82 fL). Her rhythm converted to normal sinus rhythm with 50 mg of oral metoprolol and 2 g of intravenous magnesium. Her CMRI showed dilatation of RV with moderately decreased systolic function and multiple areas of thinning and severe hypokinesis of RV with extensive fibrosis and fibro-fatty infiltration, which were consistent with ARVD (Figures  3 ,  4 ). Some areas of fibrosis in the left ventricle wall were also noted. Ejection of RV was 34%. Due to multiple episodes of non-sustained VT on 30-day cardiac event monitoring, metoprolol was discontinued, and the patient was started on sotalol. An electrophysiology consult was requested for the placement of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD).
 
The patient was monitored with telemetry for two days after placing AICD. Telemetry revealed predominantly normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions of two dominant morphologies and multiple runs of non-sustained VT. Genetic testing showed missense mutations in DSG2 and SCN5A genes associated with the autosomal-dominant version of ARVD.
