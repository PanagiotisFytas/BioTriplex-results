There has been much debate about the accuracy of ambulatory ECG monitoring with smartwatches. Many smartwatches use PPG to monitor HR. A typical PPG device contains two light sources (green light and infrared) and a photodetector to measure the reflected light, proportional to the beat-to-beat variation in blood volume. HR is then calculated from these variations. In ambulatory settings, smartwatches underestimate HR in most tachyarrhythmias, mainly when the HR is more than 100 beats/min [ 1 - 3 ]. In one study, all wearable devices tested were poor at detecting short episodes of SVT, particularly for episodes less than 60 s in duration [ 2 ]. Device algorithms filter out the transient increase in HR, treating it as noise distorting the actual signal [ 2 ]. Our patient initially relied on an Apple smartwatch (Series 3), but as it did not show any changes during her symptoms, she started using a handheld pulse oximeter. The pulse oximeter reliably revealed an HR of more than 200 beats/min during the event (Video  1 ). Usually, handheld pulse oximeters accurately estimate HR at rest and during submaximal exercise (i.e., at a rate of <155 beats/min or <89% of maximum) but tend to underestimate HR during heavy exercise [ 4 ].
ARVD is a disease caused by mutations in genes coding for components of desmosomes in myocardial skeletal muscle. The desmosome is the mechanical bridge that links one myocardial cell to the next. Mutations in these genes make desmosomes dysfunctional and account for myocyte detachment, followed by inflammation and apoptosis when it encounters undue mechanical stress. This is why ARVD is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes with undiagnosed ARVD, as increased physical activity exacerbates this progression of ARVD and associated arrhythmias [ 5 ]. More than 50% of cases are familial and inherited predominantly in an autosomal-dominant fashion, with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. In recessive forms (Naxos disease, Carvajal syndrome), cutaneous manifestations are apparent. Both forms of the disease usually manifest as palpitations and syncope commonly observed during the third decade of life [ 6 ]. In our patient, sequence analysis deletion/duplication testing showed missense mutations in DSG2 and SCN5A genes coding for desmosomes. SCN5A gene codes for sodium channels and this gene mutation is found only in 2% of ARVD cases [ 7 ]. It is generally characterized by progressive right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias, leading to sudden cardiac death. ARVD can also involve the left ventricle and cause left-sided heart failure in advanced stages of the disease [ 5 ]. Histologically, fibro-fatty tissue replaces ventricular myocardium with perpetual dilation and systolic dysfunction. VF can occur during myocardial cell death, whereas reentrant VT is related to fibro-fatty scar tissue. Scarring initially produces regional wall motion abnormalities but later may involve the free wall and become global, producing ventricular dilation. ECG findings include symmetrically inverted T waves and epsilon waves in the right precordial leads (V1, V2, and V3), possibly due to slow depolarization of the affected RV myocardium. 
According to standardized diagnostic criteria proposed by an international task force [ 8 ], the diagnosis of ARVD is based on the presence of major and minor criteria encompassing ECG, arrhythmic, RV morphological, functional, and histopathological factors. The diagnosis is achieved in the presence of two major criteria or one major plus two minor or four minor criteria from different groups [ 8 ]. In our patient, the definite diagnosis of ARVD can be made as she has more than two major criteria, CMRI finding of RV dyskinesia with foci of fat in RV myocardium, reduced systolic function of RV, T wave inversions in anterior leads, and finally witnessed VT in a left bundle branch block pattern. The presence of late gadolinium enhancement on CMRI, which correlates with the fibro-fatty changes, is a diagnostic feature of ARVD [ 9 ]. Moreover, myocyte apoptosis in patients with ARVD and increased myocardial stretch through cytokines released by adipocytes may lead to an elevated serum troponin measurement [ 10 ]. Troponin levels were elevated on several occasions in our case. 
Management of ARVD is mainly focused on the prevention of syncope and cardiac arrest through antiarrhythmic medications and an ICD. CMRI has played a significant role in diagnosing ARVD with a reasonably high sensitivity and specificity. Usually, an endomyocardial biopsy is not required to diagnose ARVD due to patchy involvement of the myocardium. 
Young age onset (<40 years), positive family history, QRS dispersion ≥40 ms, T-wave inversions beyond lead V1, left ventricular involvement, VT, syncope, and previous cardiac arrest are considered the major determinants for adverse prognosis, including sudden cardiac death [ 11 ]. The expert consensus is that ICD therapy is indicated for primary prevention for high-risk individuals and secondary prevention for those with a prior history of sustained VT [ 12 ]. 
Sotalol is considered an effective antiarrhythmic agent in the treatment of ARVD-associated arrhythmias. In addition to beta-blocker activity, it also inhibits the efflux of potassium ions, which increases the time before another electrical signal can be generated in ventricular myocytes [ 13 ]. Unfortunately, though, the mainstay of arrhythmia prevention relies on AICD device insertion, which also carries a risk of inappropriate shocks. In our patient, cardiac event monitoring revealed several episodes of NSVT before AICD implantation, which prompted the initiation of sotalol treatment.
