The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was assessed by a goodness-of-fit chi-square test for genotypes in the control groups. For baseline data, 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used for the categorical variables, and student  t  tests were used for the continuous variables to compare the differences in demographic characteristics between patients and controls. Genotype and allele frequencies among different groups were compared using the chi-square test and Fisher exact test, when appropriate. Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI, was utilized to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The haplotype construction was performed using SHEsis software ( http://analysis.bio-x.cn/myAnalysis.php ). A probability level of less than 0.05 was judged as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
