Sample collection
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of University of Debrecen Medical and Health Science Center (protocol number 3047–2009). All participating patients were properly informed and a signed written consent was obtained from adult patients and from parents of minors or children before recruitment. The study was conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1964). As it was described previously 26 patients with acquired cholesteatoma comprised of 11 females and 15 males were recruited in the study [ 18 ]. The age of cholesteatoma patients ranged between 4 and 65 years (average: 23.4 years). The tympanic membrane was perforated in all cholesteatoma patients, and all patients underwent primary or secondary surgery. Patients were divided into a pediatric (15 cases; 0–18 years) and an adult group (11 cases; over 19 years). The diagnosis of cholesteatoma in all specimens was confirmed by histopathological examination. Demographic data and a brief clinical history including the age, gender of the patients and surgical parameters of cholesteatoma were described in [ 18 ]. In addition to the 26 cholesteatoma samples, 5 control skin samples from the retroauricular region of healthy individuals were also obtained.
Total RNA extraction
To analyze gene expression levels, total RNA content was extracted from surgical samples collected immediately following surgery. Samples were fixed in RNA later  RNA Stabilization Reagent (Life Technologies) (approximately 50 μL/mg tissue) and stored at 4°C until RNA extraction. After removing the excess RNA later  solution from samples the matrixes of cholesteatoma specimens were manually cleaned from the surrounding tissues. As an average, 70 mg tissue sample were cut into thin slices and homogenized manually in TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center INC, Cincinnati, USA) using a glass-Teflon tissue homogenizer. The RiboPure kit [Ambion (Europe) LTD, Huntingdon, UK] was used to extract total RNA from the homogenates according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration, quality and integrity were evaluated by NanoDropTM 1000A spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Woolston, UK). The average RNA yield was 0.4 μg/μL and the purity index (ratio 260/280 and 260/230) was above 1.85 in all samples.
Reverse transcription
To generate first-strand cDNA a total of 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20  μL reaction volume using the High Capacity cDNA Kit with RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Woolston, UK). Briefly, 2 μg total RNA was mixed with 10.0 μL of 2× reverse transcriptase (RT) buffer, 1.0 μL 20× enzyme mix and nuclease-free water to a total volume of 20 μL. The reaction mix was then incubated first at 25°C for 10 min then at 37°C for 120 min; the reaction was terminated by incubation at 95°C for 5 min and then chilling them immediately on ice for an additional 5 min.
Primer and probes and real-time PCR detection
Target sequences were quantitated by TaqMan methodology based quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The custom made, gene specific pre-validated TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Assays-On Demand IDs: TP53: Hs00153408_m1; KRT1: Hs00196158_m1; KRT10: Hs00166289_m1; KRT19: Hs00761767_m1; MMP9: Hs00957562_m1) and the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix containing AmpliTaq Gold® DNA Polymerase were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Woolston, UK. Gene expression measurements were carried out with an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Woolston, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions; briefly 4 ng of cDNA was diluted into a total of 20 μL reaction volume containing 10 μL TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase and the target gene specific TaqMan Gene Expression Assay mix. Amplification was performed for 40 cycles, including denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds, annealing at 60°C and extension at 72°C for 60 and 30 seconds, respectively. Relative  quantification  of mRNA expression levels of the target genes  was performed using  the comparative threshold method using the PPIA gene as an endogenous reference [Assays-On Demand ID: Hs99999904_m1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)].
Statistical analysis
Results were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.; San Diego, CA, USA). Descriptive column statistics of each data set were performed and the distribution of data was analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To assess the statistical significance of differences in gene expression between multiple groups the nonparametric one-way ANOVA Kruskal–Wallis test (K-W test) in combination with the  post hoc  Dunn’s test to adjust for multiple comparisons was applied. In all tests difference was considered significant as p<0.05. Dunn’s p values were indicated as: p < 0.05(*); p < 0.01(**). The magnitude of the effect of a given gene was determined by calculating the effect size, the Cohen’s  d  value.
