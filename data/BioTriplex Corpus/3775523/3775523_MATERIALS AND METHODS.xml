Cell cultures
A prostate adenocarcinoma cell line-LNCaP cells and its isogenic subline-C4-2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. PC3 cells, a prostate carcinoma cell line were cultured in Ham's F12K medium supplemented with 7% (v/v) FBS. The following three cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 10% FBS: DU145 (a prostate carcinoma cell line), HuH-7 [a HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) cell line], and COS-1 (a green monkey kidney cell line). For the hormone-treatment experiment, we replaced FBS with CS (charcoal-stripped) FBS in steroid-depleted cell culture media.
RT–PCR (reverse transcription–PCR) and real-time PCR
RT–PCR and real-time PCR were performed as described by Lee et al. previously [ 14 ]. The following primers were used in the real-time PCR: GNMT-F (5′-GCAGCCTTCGGAGGTAAGTG) and GNMT-R (5′-GGTTTGGCCTGGCTTGTAAG) for GNMT; ACTB-F (5′-GCCGGGACCTGACTGACTAC) and ACTB-R (5′-TCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTT) for β-actin; TBP (TATA-box-binding protein)-F (5′-CAGAAGTTGGGTTTTCCAGCTAA) and TBP-R (5′-ACATCACAGCTCCCCACCAT) for TBP; and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase)-F (5′-TCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC) and GAPDH-R (5′-GCTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCA) for GAPDH. Predicted  C T  (threshold cycle) values were exported into EXCEL worksheets for analysis. Comparative  C T  methods were used to determine relative gene expression folds to β-actin, TBP or GAPDH, respectively.
Plasmids
A plasmid-pGL3-147 that we constructed previously was used in this study [ 13 ]. It contains −133/+14 core promoter region of  GNMT  and a luciferase gene. Putative AREs were identified using MatInspector program ( http://www.genomatix.de/ ). Based on the  in silico  screening, four putative AREs were identified: three AREs (ARE1-3) are located in the intron 1 of  GNMT  their locations were nucleotide numbers +266/+280, +379/+393 and +1114/+1128 of  GNMT  gene; another ARE (ARE4) is located in the intron 2 (+1788/+1802). The fifth putative ARE–ARE5 was identified by the investigator using a consensus sequence- nGnACn nnn nGTnCn  deduced from those confirmed AREs published previously [ 15 – 18 ]. Both intron 1 and 2 fragments of the human  GNMT  gene were generated by PCR using the  GNMT  genomic DNA clone 6-1 [ 10 ] as a template. The primers used were PS6598 (5′-ATTACGCGTGTGCCCAGGCCGGG) and PA7834 (5′-ATTACGCGTCTGAGTACGGCCAGCGAG) for intron 1, and PS7963 (5′-GCGACGCGTGTATGCAGGTCTAGCCAG) and PA8385 (5′-GCGACGCGTCTAGGGGTCAGGAAGAGA) for intron 2. PCR products were digested with MluI and cloned into pGL3-147 to generate p147-Intron1 and p147-Intron2, respectively. The constructs containing wt (wild-type) or mutated ARE5 were generated by inserting the annealed SacI–NheI fragments to pGL3-promoter or pGL3-147. pGL3-promoter contains a SV40 (simian virus 40) promoter (Promega). Oligonucleotides were crA-SacI-F (5′-cTGGACAGCGTGTACCg) and crA-NheI-R (5′-ctagcGGTACACGCTGTCCAgagct) for wt ARE5, and mcrA-SacI-F (5′-cTAGGTAGCGTATCTCg) and mcrA-NheI-R (5′-ctagcGAGATACGCTACCTAgagct) for mutated ARE5. The pSG5-AR AR-expressing plasmid used in these experiments was provided by Dr Chawnshang Chang of the University of Rochester. The AR-responsive ARE-directed luciferase reporter plasmid (pMMTV(murine mammary tumour virus)-luc) was kindly provided by Dr Hsiu-Ming Shih of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taiwan.
RGA (reporter gene assay)
Cells from different cell lines mentioned above were seeded onto 12-well plates (1.2×10 5  cells per well) and grown overnight in medium with 10% CS FBS for 24 h prior to transfection. The medium was refreshed 2 h prior to transfection. Transfection was performed via calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Cells were co-transfected with or without pSG5-AR and different luciferase gene constructs. Either pRL-TK or pSV40-β-Gal transfection was used for normalization of the transfection efficiency. The 16 h after transfection, cells were treated with solvent (ethanol) or 10 nM R1881 for 24 h and then they were harvested for reporter analysis. Bicalutamide was used as an androgen antagonist. Luciferase activity was measured using either Dual-luciferase reporter assay system or Luciferase Assay System (both from Promega); β-galactosidase activity was measured using a β-galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega).
EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay)
Detailed procedures of EMSA have been described previously [ 13 ]. In brief, nuclear extracts were prepared from COS-1 cells. For AR expression, COS-1 cells were transfected with pSG5-AR using Lipofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Oligonucleotides were synthesized for wt and mt (mutated) GNMT putative AREs. Sequences were 5′-GGGTCT GTCTCA GCC TGTACT GCGCGGCCGCAGA-3′ for wt-ARE1, 5′-CCTGCCCGGC AGAACA GGC ACTGCG AGTGCCCCGTG-3′ for wt-ARE2, 5′-CCTGTGCTCT AAACCA CCA TGTTCT ACTGCCTTTTG-3′ for wt-ARE3/YY1, 5′-CCTGTGCTCT cAcCtc CCA gtgggg ACTGCCTTTTG-3′ for mt-ARE3/YY1, 5′-ATGG TGGACA GCG TGTACC GGAC-3′ for wt-ARE5, and 5′-ATGG TaGgtA GCG TaTctC GGAC-3′ for mt-ARE5 (putative ARE sequences are underlined; mutations are indicated by lowercase letters). Consensus ARE and YY1 oligonucleotides were used as a control, or for competition assay. Sequences were 5′-GTCT GGTACA GGG TGTTCT TTTT for conARE [ 19 ] and 5′-CGCTCCGCGGCCATCTTGGCGGCTGGT for conYY1 [ 20 ]. Oligonucleotides were annealed and labelled with γ- 32 P-ATP. Labelled probes were incubated with 4 μg nuclear extracts, 1 μg poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg BSA in 1 × binding buffer [10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9; 8% (v/v) glycerol; 0.05 mM EDTA; 2.5 mM MgCl 2 ; 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol); 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100] for 30 min at room temperature (25°C). For our competition experiments, 50- and 100-folds of unlabelled double-stranded oligonucleotides were incubated for 15 min prior to adding the labelled probes. Antibodies to AR (sc-815) and YY1 transcription factor (sc-1703) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Complexes were separated on 4% (w/v) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, which were dried and analysed using autoradiography.
ChIP (chromatin Immunoprecipitation) and PCR
LNCaP cells were cross-linked with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and the chromatins were obtained through sonication. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-AR antibody (sc-816), anti-YY1 antibody (sc-1703) or normal rabbit IgG at 4°C overnight. Precipitates were washed and the samples were extracted with elution buffer and heated to 65°C to reverse the crosslink reaction. Subsequently, the DNA fragments were purified with phenol/chloroform. For ChIP assay with anti-AR, a pair of PCR primers was designed to span the putative AREs of GNMT exon 1: forward primer (5′-GGCTGCCAGCAGTGCTTATG); reverse primer (5′-CGATATACAGCTGCCACACG). PCR products were run on 2% (w/v) agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide for visualization. For ChIP assay with anti-YY1, the immunoprecipitated DNA was analysed by real-time PCR as described above with two primer sets: p1 forward (5′-GGCGCGTGTCACCATGTCCC), p1 reverse (5′-CCCAGCGAAGGAAGGCATCA); p2 forward (5′-CGCCGTGTTAGCCAGGATGGT), p2 reverse (5′-GAGAGACAGACAAGCTGAGGCT).
