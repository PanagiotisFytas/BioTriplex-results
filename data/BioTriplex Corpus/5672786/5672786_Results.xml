Bacterial communities in GCF of individuals with and without periodontitis
Following parallel sequencing of the 31 GCF samples, 150,990 high-quality reads were obtained. Clustering of all the qualified sequences at a 97% similarity level generated 2,322 OTUs, and more than 62% were shared by the healthy and periodontitis groups (Venn diagram inset in Figure  1 ). α - diversity was similar between individuals with and without periodontitis ( P  > 0.05). However, β-diversity comparisons displayed a significant difference between the healthy and periodontitis groups in CAP plots (Figure  1 ).
The sequences were further divided into 13 phyla, 22 classes, 38 orders, 79 families, 154 genera, and 510 species. The majority of OTUs belonged to five major phyla (average ≥5%), including  Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria , and  Actinobacteria  (Supplementary Table  2 ). The differences in the bacterial community composition were found at all taxonomic levels, including two minor phyla, four classes, six orders, eight families, 14 genera, and 43 species with significantly ( P  < 0.05) different relative abundance in the periodontitis group compared with the healthy group (Figure  2 ).
Different bacterial distribution patterns in GCF of individuals with and without periodontitis
To determine if there was a difference in the microbial communities between the GCF of individuals with and without periodontitis, Schoener's abundance-based co-occurrence probability analyses were performed for each group of genera. Two heatmaps (Figures  3A,B ) from the resulting Schoener's index matrixes (Supplementary Tables  3 ,  4 ) were drawn to visually assess the bacterial structure within each group. All genera in each group were assembled into two clusters from the root of a dendrogram based on the similarity of their co-occurrence probabilities.
The analyses revealed a genera co-occurrence in the GCF of the periodontitis group compared to the GCF of the healthy group. For example, the genus  Peptostreptococcaceae _XI_G_1 showed a significantly increased co-occurrence with other genera ( P  < 0.01). The Schoener's index values between  Peptostreptococcaceae _XI_G_1 and  Bacillus  increased 3.7-fold in the GCF of individuals with periodontitis. However, the co-occurrence of the genus  Leptotrichiaceae _G_1 with other genera significantly decreased ( P  < 0.01). The Schoener's index values between  Leptotrichiaceae _G_1 and another two genera ( Leptotrichia  and  Aggregatibacter ) decreased 4.32- and 55-fold, respectively, in the GCF of individuals with periodontitis.
Furthermore, higher frequencies of extreme Schoener's value (i.e., ranging from 0.5 to 1 or ranging from 0 to 0.1) were detected from the healthy individuals compared with the periodontitis patients (Figure  3C ), and a significantly higher value for Schoener's index was detected in the GCF from periodontitis patients (inset in Figure  3C ,  P  < 0.001). These scenarios suggested that periodontitis was prone to high co-occurrence probabilities across more genera, and thereby probably generating different distribution patterns within the healthy and periodontitis groups.
The result demonstrates that polymicrobial community differed between the healthy and the periodontitis groups. The difference is attributed toward the co-occurrence of larger number of microbial communities at the genus level in the periodontitis group.
Cytokines and their relations with the bacterial community structure in the GCF of samples with and without periodontitis
A difference is the cytokine composition was observed between GCF with and without periodontitis. Of the 20 cytokines examined (details in Supplementary Table  5 ), CRP was significantly (one-way ANOVA,  P  < 0.05) higher in the GCF of the periodontitis group while IL-8 was significantly (one-way ANOVA,  P  < 0.01) higher in the GCF of the healthy group.
Significant correlations were detected between pairs of cytokines (Figure  4 , Supplementary Table  6 ), while variations in cytokines across the individuals could not be explained by the two groups, as we previously hypothesized ( P  > 0.1). Nevertheless, based on the distance matrix, the Mantel test revealed a significant concordance between the two data sets, i.e., between cytokines and microbiota, in the healthy group (Mantel statistic  r  = 0.36,  P  ≤ 0.05) rather than in the periodontitis group (Mantel statistic  r  = 0.013,  P  = 0.434). The results were further confirmed by the PROTEST test in the healthy (m 12  = 0.61,  P  < 0.05) and periodontitis (m 12  = 0.68,  P  = 0.933) groups, respectively. Configurations of cytokines could optimally fit to those of microbiomes in the healthy group but could not in the periodontitis group (Figure  5A ).
To detect the specific effects, the correlations were also examined between cytokines and microbiomes at the genus level (Figure  5B , Supplementary Table  7 ). As shown in Table  1 , MMP-9, osteoactivin, IL-8, and MIP-1a were significantly associated with bacterial composition at the phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels. CRP was also associated with bacterial composition at the species level, in addition to IL-8, MIP-1a, MMP-9, and osteoactivin. In turn, the bacterial taxa, from phylum to species levels, significantly influenced the cytokines, as listed in Table  2 . The variation in cytokines communities could be significantly explained by 10 oral taxa belonging to five phyla.
