Subjects and specimen collection
Volunteers were selected from Meipo Village in Jishi Shan (Gansu, China) in September 2013. Subjects who had systemic diseases or immune suppression, had taken antibiotics within the previous 2 months, were pregnant, or were smokers were excluded from this study. Then, 31 subjects, including 16 with and 15 without periodontitis, were recruited (Supplementary Table  1 ). A complete clinical examination, including medical and dental histories and an intra-oral examination, was performed by a trained examiner. Pocket probing depths (PD) and clinical attachment loss (Shaddox et al.,  2011 ) were measured at six sites (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, distolingual, lingual, and mesiolingual) according to the Community Periodontal Index (Kinney et al.,  2011 ). Periodontitis patients had PD ≥ 5 mm, CAL ≥ 2 mm, and gingival bleeding on probing (BOP) ≥ 30%; whereas healthy controls had no CAL and probing depths ≤3 mm (information is presented in Supplementary Table  1 ). The volunteers were fully informed of the research objectives and provided written informed consent after the research was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Northwest University for Nationalities. Studies involving humans conform to the guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
GCF extracts
After the supragingival plaque was removed and the target sites dried, four sterile Whatman 3 MM papers were gently inserted for 10 s into the mesio-(one paper), mid-(two papers), and distobuccal orifices (one paper) of the gingival crevice of two molars (first molar or second molar) with the deepest attachment loss for the individuals with periodontitis and of the left upper first molar for the healthy individuals. The four papers were then cut equally from the center line that was vertical to the insertion edge using sterile scissors, transferred to two sterile 1.5-mL tubes separately, and stored at −80°C until use (Sakiyama et al.,  2010 ). No blood was wicked by the sterile paper strips, and microbial genomic DNA and cytokines were both detected in the two tubes, respectively.
Cytokine detection
GCF samples were eluted from Whatman filter paper in 80 μL of PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mg/mL phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to inhibit the protease activity. Twenty proteins were selected, including CRP, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1a), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-13, osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN), osteoactivin, receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), all of which have been associated with periodontitis (Garlet,  2010 ; Shaddox et al.,  2011 ). Cytokines were detected using a Human Cytokine Antibody Array Kit (QAH-PDD-1, RayBiotech, Norcross, GA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after blocking, the chips were incubated at room temperature (RT) for 2 h with 50 μL of fresh GCF samples. The chips were then washed and incubated for 2 h with biotin-conjugated antibodies at RT. The chips were washed again and incubated for 1 h with Cy3 equivalent dye-conjugated streptavidin in the dark at room temperature. After additional washes, the signals were visualized using a laser scanner, and the data were extracted using Axon GenePix software.
DNA extraction, library construction, and sequencing
DNA was extracted from the GCF samples using the MicroElute Genomic DNA Kit (OMEGA, Guangzhou, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firstly, 200 μL of buffer (100 mmoL Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); 25 mmoL EDTA (pH 8.0); 500 mmoL NaCl; 1% SDS; 20 mg/mL lysozyme; 10 mg/mL RNase A) were added to the tubes, and then incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Secondly, 20 μL of protease K (10 mg/mL) were add to the tubes, mixed fully, and incubated at 55°C for 50 min. The DNA was extracted by elution of the columns. To determine the bacterial communities in each GCF sample, the V1-V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the primers 8F and 533R (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′ and 5′-TTA CCG CGG CTG CTG GCA C-3′, respectively). Each sample was tagged by adding an index sequence extension at the 5′ end of the forward primers for multiplexing to allow simultaneous analyses of several samples in a single sequencing run. PCR amplification was performed in triplicate using an Eppendorf MasterCycler Ep Gradient Thermal Cycler (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, USA) in a total volume of 25 μL, containing 9 μL of sterilized water, 5 μL of 5 × PCR buffer, 5 μL of 5 × PCR GC high enhancer, 2 μL of dNTPs (2.5 mM), 2 μL of template DNA (200 ng/μL), 0.25 μL of TaKaRa polymerase (5 U/μL), and 1 μL of each primer (10 μM). The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 98°C for 5 min, followed by 27 cycles at 98°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. Following the amplification, 3 μL of PCR product was used for agarose gel (2.0%) detection. The triplicate PCR reactions for each sample preparation were combined and quantified by PicoGreen using a FLUOstar Optima (BMG Labtech, Jena, Germany). The PCR product from each sample was pooled with those of the other samples for one sequencing run. After quality control using Agilent 2100, the pooled mixture was re-quantified with PicoGreen. Pyrosequencing was performed using a Roche GS FLX+ system (Roche, Switzerland).
All sequencing data have been submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at NCBI under Project ID SRP118852.
Sequencing data analysis
All raw sequences were trimmed using the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) toolkit v.1.5.0 (Caporaso et al.,  2010 ). Next, the sequences were further trimmed by QIIME to exclude the reads that were shorter than 150 bp, harbored an average quality lower than Q25, exhibited a homopolymer longer than 8 bp or more than one mismatch at the 5′-end, or contained any ambiguous bases. Chimeric sequences were identified and removed using UCHIME (Edgar et al.,  2011 ). The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered with a 97% similarity cut-off using QIIME. Singletons of representative OTUs were removed to reach taxon counts more than 0.001% of the total sequences, and then assigned taxonomically using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier (Cole et al.,  2005 ) and the BLAST tool of the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD;  http://www.homd.org/ ; Dewhirst et al.,  2010 ).
Sampling efficiency was evaluated by rarefaction curves using QIIME. The Shannon–Wiener, Simpson (Chao et al.,  1992 ), Chao, and ACE (Chao and Shen,  2003 ) indices were calculated to measure α-diversity using the Mothur software ( http://www.mothur.org/ ). To estimate β-diversity, the Bray–Curtis (abundance-based) and weighted UniFrac (phylogenetic-based) distance matrices were calculated through QIIME. Comparison of β-diversity between H and P was performed by Constrained Principal Coordinates Analysis (CAP) using the vegan package in R (version 3.1.1). Schoener's index (abundance-based; measuring the co-occurrence probability of two taxa; Schoener,  1992 ) was computed for each pair of genera across the samples using the R spa package. Heatmaps for evaluating the distribution pattern at the genus level based on Schoener's index in the two groups were drawn using the heatmaps package in R. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Redundancy Analysis (RDA) were performed using the vegan package in R. The significance of constraints for PCA and RDA, as well as the significant variables in RDA, were also detected using the vegan package in R. The matrix of correlations and  P -values for cytokines were calculated using the Hmisc package in R. The correlation matrices between microbes and cytokines were computed by the Mantel test, Procrustes (PROTEST) test, and Correlation matrix using the vegan and CCA package in R, respectively. The correlation coefficients were calculated from the relative abundance of genera, and the significance of correlations was estimated. Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) was used to determine the taxa that characterized the differences in bacterial composition between the H and P groups. Specifically, the non-parametric factorial Kruskal–Wallis sum-rank test was used to detect taxa whose relative abundance was significantly different, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used to estimate the effect size of each differentially abundant taxon (Giardine et al.,  2005 ; Blankenberg et al.,  2010 ; Goecks et al.,  2010 ).
